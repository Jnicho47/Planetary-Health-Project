Intersession 2025,,['Homewood Campus'],11,Navigating Your Medical Future Through Self-Authorship,"Innovation in the world of medicine is fueled by individuals who are inspired by their lived experiences and stimulated by their curiosities. Consciously and unconsciously, our lived experiences impact our decision-making, and through reflection and contextual frameworks, we can curate lives that connect to our values and passions. This course aims to create opportunities for students to understand self-authorship as a beneficial process for personal development. They will self-reflect in a way that encourages purpose-focused career exploration in medicine. This process will enhance their personal ability to make internally focused decisions in their professional pursuits. Students will begin to identify how their personal stories, passions, and intellectual curiosities contribute to their distinctiveness in the medical school application process and beyond. Integrated with frameworks from life-design theory, self-authorship, and career development, this course will help discourage the check-box approach to medicine and encourage utilizing personal experiences as a tool in developing a well-rounded medical school application.","['AS Biology', 'AS Summer and Intersession Programs']",Krieger School of Arts and Sciences,1.00,

Intersession 2025,,['Homewood Campus'],12,Narrating Violence after Second-Wave Feminism,"Feminist theory equips us to perceive gender at work in the organisation of literary texts, and to criticise those texts that reproduce oppression in image and narrative. The notoriously transgressive novel American Psycho (1991) seems to call for this kind of reading. Its protagonist is a man whose masculinity consists of extreme violence and utterly degraded consumerism. He can speak only in the language of electronics catalogues, fashion magazines, and unfeeling pornography. But is it possible to see in American Psycho a continuation of the second-wave feminist project? Is the vice-president’s-eye-view of Manhattan a satire, a diagnosis of patriarchy in its purest form? And what does it mean to document, fantasise, or regurgitate the violence at the heart of gender? In this course, we place American Psycho in its historical and aesthetic context by reading it alongside the literary work of Kathy Acker and Virginie Despentes and the polemical theory of Andrea Dworkin. We will see, in their critique and feminist reinvention of forms such as pastiche, assemblage, voice, perspective, and the narrator, new and enduring strategies for the reflexive reading of literature. This course comes with a strong content warning for the graphic representation and autobiographical discussion of sexual violence.","['AS English', 'AS Summer and Intersession Programs']",Krieger School of Arts and Sciences,1.00,
Intersession 2025,,['Homewood Campus'],12,Fantastical Environmentalism,"Fantasy and fantastic science fiction love environmentalist themes. Whether it’s an abundance of mythologically-inspired creatures, quests across diverse landscapes, or veiled allegories of an environmental apocalypse, the fantastic deeply engages the nonhuman world, a fascinating paradox in an age that relies on science to know, make sense of, an address the ecological crisis we’re facing. So what does fantasy offer environmentalist causes? In this course, we’ll explore this question, starting with a brief sojourn into the fantastical nineteenth-century roots of the environmentalist movement in the thick of the Industrial and settler revolutions. Then, we’ll spend the bulk of the class looking at several present-day examples, such as Studio Ghibli’s Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind, the recent animated series Scavenger’s Reign, and the cozy indie game A Short Hike. Students will have the opportunity to discuss a fantastical element from these or the media of their choice in a short final presentation.","['AS English', 'AS Summer and Intersession Programs']",Krieger School of Arts and Sciences,2.00,
Intersession 2025,,['Homewood Campus'],21,Cowboy Carter,"“It comes as a great shock around the age of 5, 6, or 7 to discover that the flag to which you have pledged allegiance, along with everybody else, has not pledged allegiance to you. It comes as a great shock to see Gary Cooper killing off the Indians, and although you are rooting for Gary Cooper, that the Indians are you.” (James Baldwin, “The American Dream and the American Negro”) This class situates Beyoncé’s genre-bending COWBOY CARTER within a tradition of twentieth-century Black cultural production about the American West. By engaging with music, visual media, film, and a variety of written forms, students will gain a deeper understanding of the role of the West—as a region, idea, and ethos—in African American intellectual history and popular culture. Primary texts may include works by Nat Love (a.k.a. Deadwood Dick), James Baldwin, Ralph Ellison, and Angela Y. Davis, and critical readings will introduce students to the study of the Western and the burgeoning subfield of Beyoncé Studies. The course culminates in a discussion of the two most famous pieces of Black Western media: Quentin Tarantino’s Django Unchained and Beyoncé’s COWBOY CARTER.","['AS English', 'AS Summer and Intersession Programs']",Krieger School of Arts and Sciences,1.00,

Demystifying the Entertainment Business is a 4-day intensive course that offers students an insight into: possible behind-the-camera careers in the field (specifically writing, directing, producing, and developing), how to best prepare for those careers, and how to break into the industry once graduation finally comes. Led by JHU alum and TV writer/director/producer, Luke Kelly-Clyne, student assignments will cover a wide range depending on the lesson. Those interested in the course should be prepared to write scripts, read scripts, shoot and edit videos, and create career goal maps and resumes. A virtual screening of all the final film projects will be scheduled for the week following the last class -- attendance is optional but encouraged. (Note: some level of shooting and editing acumen will be necessary for this course, whether it's done by students or their friends, a short film deliverable will be part of the equation for successful course completion.)","['AS Film and Media Studies', 'AS Summer and Intersession Programs']",Krieger School of Arts and Sciences,1.00,

We will explore how toxicity comes to be defined, identified, measured, and quantified and identify the ways in which toxicity is sensed, perceived, and imagined.  We will consider the relational aspects of toxicity—how it comes to make or rupture social worlds.

The course asks: What forms do sartorial representations take in spaces of protest? Can we extend the notion of “nonverbal resistance” (Crane,2000) to read the convergence of protest attire with its circulation, perception and production? The course will invite students to examine how protest, textile manufacturing and sartorial choices are embedded within our social worlds. We will read anthropological, literary and visual texts to consider how the sartorial makeup of protest sites shows an intersection of institutions, traditional knowledge and even personal intimacies. Students will familiarise themselves with sartorial spectacles and subversions in resistance movements particularly in the contexts of militancy, gendered labor, displacement and the neoliberal exploitation of garment industries. We will also look at the formation of uneven social identities through sartorial encounters and the contemporary relevance of sartorial mobilisation.","['AS Anthropology', 'AS Summer and Intersession Programs']",Krieger School of Arts and Sciences,1.00,

Through both theoretical discussions and practical case studies, students will gain a deep understanding of how global pro-democracy networks operate, the challenges they face, and strategies for resisting authoritarianism. Students will learn strategies for organizing and sustaining democratic movements, with a focus on how international networks of activists operate in hostile environments and the ways they collaborate to counter the influence of autocratic regimes. They will also critically engage with the implications of global democratic backsliding for the health of democracy in the United States. By the end of the course, students will be equipped to engage in global pro-democracy efforts with practical insights into organizing and sustaining democratic movements.

The class begins with an exploration of democratic deficits and the limitations of our current governance structures. Students will be introduced to democratic innovations, the deliberative wave and citizens’ assemblies and asked to consider how to effectively mobilize around such platforms. Seeking practical and replicable practices, we will examine a model for Activated Citizenship and study the ways that participants come together, learn, engage and find their voice. Marshalling evidence-based practices, students will actively engage with a variety of materials, including reports, academic journals and news media. We will conduct cross-cultural comparisons of four citizens’ assemblies including the French Citizens’ Convention for the Climate (2019-2020) as well as the more recent French Citizens’ Convention on the End of Life (2022-23), the Deliberative Committee on Homelessness (2021) in Brussels, The Second Citizens’ Assembly on Democratic Expression (2021-22) in Canada and the Petaluma Fairgrounds Advisory Panel (2023) in the United States. Each Case Study is considered within a carefully designed framework for Citizens’ Assemblies, alongside an analysis of the variables that enhance Activated Citizenship in government-initiated and championed Citizens’ Assemblies. The final class will be a design lab where students will be asked to bring their own understandings and practices to the table, deliberate and create a blueprint for more meaningful and consequential public engagement interventions that mobilize, inspire, and generate a more inclusive and responsive democratic culture.","['AS Agora Institute', 'AS Summer and Intersession Programs']",Krieger School of Arts and Sciences,1.00,

From Marina Abramović’s “The Artist is Present” and Black Mirror’s interactive episode “Bandersnatch” to the breaking of the fourth wall in Fleabag, the imperative of the new century is to be present, immersed, and to touch things directly. This course explores the artistic drive for total absorption and investigates the ethical implications of placing the self at the center of contemporary production. Is self-inscription the same as self-discovery, or is it just narcissism? When fiction and theory encounter first-person narrations and become autofiction and autotheory, do they limit our imagination? Or are they the place where critical thought encounters the affective, embodied domain of lived experience? Can theory be a place of “healing” as bell hooks famously proposed? Or are we stuck with what Anna Kornbluh calls antitheory? Throughout the course, we will ask how these emerging genres interact with old ones and study the specific ways they engage with gender, race, sexuality, displacement, and nationality. By the end of this course, students will be familiar with Karl Ove Knausgaard, Maggie Nelson, Paul Preciado, and other writers, theorists, and filmmakers, assembling an archive of literature, art, media, and theory across the Americas and Europe.","['AS Modern Languages and Literatures', 'AS Summer and Intersession Programs']",Krieger School of Arts and Sciences,1.00,

In this course, we will examine how the family unit is often depicted in literature: the way families are structured and the ways they fracture, the horrors or affection members of the family inflict and bestow on each other, and the way love and obligation differ across families. Our goal is to comb through these narratives for insight and techniques on how to tell our own stories about the family. This is a multigenre class — we will read fiction, nonfiction, and poetry from acclaimed writers like Alice Munro, Dantiel W.

In Mary Kelly's Post-partum Document, Kelly collects and collages ephemera from the first six years of her son's life, juxtaposing recordings of his first words, soiled diapers, old clothes with her own journal entries, charting both his and her transformation over time. This course seeks to explore how we can go beyond just the written word in our work, and how pairing it with images, ephemera, and other forms of art can enhance our own vision for our projects. What can collage accomplish? How can we best utilize juxtaposition to tell a story? What is the line between art and gimmick? The course will include discussion of collage works and scholarly analysis on such works, as well as in-studio collage time, and culminate in a workshop of students' own short collaged works that play with form, text, and images to tell a story. Works studied may include selections from Nox by Anne Carson, Post-partum Document by Mary Kelly, What It Is by Lynda Barry, Blackouts by Justin Torres, Here Comes Kitty by Danielle Dutton and Richard Kraft, Citizen by Claudia Rankine, Dictee by Theresa Hak Kyung Cha, ""White Dialogues"" by Bennett Sims, and Sans Soleil (film) by Chris Marker.","['AS Summer and Intersession Programs', 'AS Writing Seminars']",Krieger School of Arts and Sciences,1.00,

What is the importance of self-care for public health professionals? What are the various ways that self-care can look? And how does storytelling play into self-care? This course will explore the answers to all of these questions.
 
In health and medicine, we often turn to authority figures and experts for the answers to problems, whether those be individuals such as doctors or government organizations such as the NIH or CDC. This paradigm often creates a dichotomy between patient and practitioner. What is missing in this paradigm is that patients and community members also have answers—answers that can inform the root causes of health issues as well as public health policy and practice. Storytelling and narrative writing are critical methods for uncovering these answers and for building a rapport among patients, practitioners, and communities.
 
Storytelling is also a powerful tool for self-care and healing, which are necessary ingredients for success in public health professions. This course will give you permission (read: require you!) to engage in daily self-care and reflect on your self-care activities.
 
Classes will include a combination of daily ice breakers, discussions, journaling activities, and a personal health improvement project, all of which will give us an opportunity to reflect on our life experiences and aspirations, help us better understand ourselves and one another, and equip us to be even stronger public health professionals.
 
In addition to being instructive, this class is going to be fun! It will be a safe space to talk about pretty much anything that’s on your mind. This syllabus is not by any means set in stone and will rather be guided by what you wish to discuss and get out of the course.","['AS Public Health Studies', 'AS Summer and Intersession Programs']",Krieger School of Arts and Sciences,1.00,

Similar to humans, the machine (like AI system) can simulate the world through machine imagination. ""Machine Imagination"" is a course that delves into how artificial intelligence can simulate creative and imaginative processes traditionally associated with human thought.  In this course, I will first connect machine imagination to theories of human imagination and mental models from a cognitive science perspective. Then, students will explore machine imagination from computer science perspectives, through learning the advanced topics in generative models, such as variational autoencoders and diffusion models with vivid examples.
