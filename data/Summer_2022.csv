Summer 2022,,['Homewood Campus'],21,Decoding College Writing,"This course examines three broad types of writing students will encounter at and beyond Hopkins: narrative writing, analytical writing, and technical writing. Each has its own implications within the walls of JHU, from research papers to creative projects, but each will extend to the opportunities students pursue outside of academia. Above all, this course demystifies the idea that some writers just “have it” by decoding the processes that lead to great writing and building students’ confidence in written expression to carry forward into their studies and professional pursuits. (Only students in the Hop-In Program are permitted to enroll in this course.)","['AS Summer and Intersession Programs', 'AS Writing Program']",Krieger School of Arts and Sciences,3.00,

However, the ability to edit plant and animal genomes, including human genomes, comes with significant ethical considerations.  This course will utilize a hybrid classroom-laboratory approach to provide students with both a comprehensive knowledge of the CRISPR system and a deeper understanding of how gene function is studied.  At the end of the semester, you will not only understand how CRISPR works, but also have a better understanding of the power of genetics to illuminate molecular mechanisms of protein function.","['AS Biology', 'AS Summer and Intersession Programs']",Krieger School of Arts and Sciences,3.00,

Select professional screenplays will be read and analyzed — and clips from select films viewed — to further explore what works well on the page, and how it translates to working well onscreen.

We should train our analytic eyes, however, to see beneath the surface of day-to-day and even decade-to-decade political turbulence. We should focus, instead, on the pronounced secular trend of more than two and a quarter centuries of American history. Two hundred years ago, presidents were weak and often bullied by Congress. Today, presidents are powerful and often thumb their noses at Congress and the courts.

We engage eco-socialist, eco-feminist, science studies, and new materialist thinkers, who in their respective ways problematize both apolitical approaches to ecology and non-ecological approaches to politics. Moreover, the very concepts of “nature”, “politics”, “ecology”, and “power” are rethought in innovative ways, yielding distinctive interpretations of our predicament and entailing political and ethical proposals.

Summer 2022,,['Online'],82,Writing the Unreal,"""We left what we felt at what we saw,” the poet Wallace Stevens once wrote, suggesting writing involves a direct response to our experiences of reality. In this class, we’ll look exclusively at writing which takes on what hasn’t been seen, and hasn’t been felt. Through reading works of science fiction, magical realism, gothic literature, and speculative fiction, students will investigate how the unreal can still speak to our experiences and perceptions of the real. Additionally, students will get the chance to craft their own fantastical worlds through regular writing assignments. Tales of time travelers, haunted houses, unreal languages, and reimagined cities will be covered. Readings will include selections from Paul Beatty, Octavia Butler, Italo Calvino, Ursula K. Le Guin, Yoko Ogawa, and Mary Shelley.","['AS Summer and Intersession Programs', 'AS Writing Seminars']",Krieger School of Arts and Sciences,3.00,

Summer 2022,,['Online'],88,Star Trek Music- The Franchise Frontier,"Music defines the Star Trek experience. Through their continued reuse and repetition, Star Trek’s many musical themes go beyond their original audiovisual frameworks to operate as learned musical-cultural texts. As Star Trek has expanded its content into a myriad of installments and media platforms, this musical symbolism has proved vital in articulating both these differences and “sameness.”

This online, asynchronous course uses Star Trek’s music as a tool to investigate musical branding and the creation of meaning in the media we consume every day. Through close viewings—and listenings—of film, television episodes, video games, computer games, commercials, and other media, we will explore the meaning(s) these media construct and acquire as they are re-used and re-purposed in audiovisual contexts. Your work will include studying media clips, television episodes, and some feature-length films; short readings in which we interact with both current and classic scholarly literature; regular discussion posts and responses to our content; a weekly reflection journal of short posts; and a final paper/project on a Star Trek music topic of your choice (1500 words). In so doing, we will hone your analytical skills by learning to critically evaluate filmic media and craft arguments about the roles of music/sound in film.","['AS Music', 'AS Summer and Intersession Programs']",Krieger School of Arts and Sciences,3.00,

Summer 2022,,['Online'],81,Climate Anthropology and Changing Communities,"Coastal, arctic, and arid ecosystems are significantly affected by climate change. This course invites us to think about small rural communities that have been profoundly affected by climate change. By exploring multiple ethnographic case studies and applying multiple theoretical models, the course offers anthropological insights into how the people in these areas interact with their environment over their lives. While examining the inhabitants’ knowledge-based views of climate and local socioecological systems, students in this course will develop more robust, flexible models of anthropological analysis for climate change (in general) and for smaller ecosystems (in particular). By examining the impact of climate devastation on the local scale, the course contributes to a better understanding of how environmental changes impact people, traditions, economies, politics and health on the global scale, and help students develop new ideas for effective climate communication, community engagement, and the development of future climate and energy policy that addresses the needs of communities.","['AAP Energy Policy and Climate', 'AAP Environmental Sciences']",Krieger School of Arts and Sciences Advanced Academic Programs,3.00,

Electricity generation or storage related topics include (1) Fuel cells and batteries, including hydrogen fuel cells, batteries with different lithium-ion chemistries, and flow batteries, including integration with solar and wind (2) ocean wave devices, with an emphasis on the energy in traveling ocean waves, and how some of this wave energy can be absorbed and converted to electricity, through ideas related to natural frequency and forced damped oscillations, (3) new approaches to carbon capture and sequestration (CCS), such as the proposed Allam cycle - which is a type of closed cycle combustion turbine (CT), where the use of super-critical carbon dioxide rather air as the working fluid facilitates CCS (4) nuclear energy, from small modular fission to fusion. The course will also look at some important applications of electricity, including light emitting diodes (LEDs). The 2014 Nobel prize for physics went to inventors of the first blue LEDs using high band-gap semi-conductors, like indium gallium nitride which has made their widespread use for high quality white light applications possible. LEDs - as will be explained - are similar to (the p-n junctions in) PV cells but with higher band gaps, and operated to run backwards using an electrical source, so that electrical power is converted to visible light with much higher efficiency than with traditional incandescent light bulbs.

Said’s landmark postcolonial text Orientalism, which analyzes dynamics of hegemony, power, knowledge, imagination, and representation in ways that challenge how we think and know about the world. This lens of inquiry will take a political turn by examining issues and conflicts that arise due to imperialism and dominant paradigms of culture, difference, otherness, nationalism, and religion. In the latter portion of the course, close readings of contemporary world literatures will unfold the shared intimate experiences between East and West through the study of transformative novels, memoirs, and short stories that create forms of agency in today’s world. This will bring us beyond the limiting binary of East and West and enable new ways to think intimately and humanistically about religion/secularity, gender, nation, identity, and belonging.","['AAP Liberal Arts', 'AAP Writing']",Krieger School of Arts and Sciences Advanced Academic Programs,3.00,

Deep Ecology asks deep questions and aims to bring about long-range goals in moving away from anthropocentrism to ecocentrism, calling for a major paradigm shift in perception, values, and lifestyles. Planetary and human survival is at stake due to climate change — this is humanity’s global ultimate concern. Scientists, environmental activists, and representatives of humanities agree that we need a new paradigm shift, that it is unsustainable to treat the living earth organism as an infinite resource of “energy.” Western environmental practices have been based on anthropocentric view of nature where humans occupy the top of the hierarchy in the chain of life. There is an urgent need for a new environmental ethic that will fundamentally reorient humans in their thinking and relating to the natural environment. The course examines cross-cultural perspectives of environmental ethics that are rooted in Western/scientific, Eastern, and Indigenous worldviews and religions.

Summer 2022,,['Online'],80,NAGPRA: Repatriation as Compliance or Ethical Practice,"In the United States, the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA) outlines a process by which government agencies (and those who receive government funding) must return human remains and sacred objects to those who claim them. Repatriation is a complicated process because it means something different in almost every case. One of its earliest claims took 20-years to resolve. In 2017, the Ancient One was returned to the tribes of the Columbia River for reburial after DNA tests proved the relationship that tribes had claimed all along. But now reproductions of the Ancient One’s skull are being sold by a company that holds the copyright. When those from outside the culture to which he was returned can examine and/or profit from a replica, the distinction between compliance with the law and the ethics of return is clear. Outside of the United States, few repatriation laws exist and many argue that institutions like The British Museum are the best places to protect world heritage. Is providing care of and access to human remains and cultural objects preferable over returning heritage to those from which it was taken? In this course, we examine repatriation claims around the globe in order to critique NAGPRA and establish a compliance toolkit. Where NAGPRA doesn’t apply, heritage professionals can use the successes and failures of past repatriations, and a firm grounding in ethics, to make repatriation decisions. Nothing in NAGPRA prohibits practitioners from exceeding its scope and seeking out opportunities to build relationships with descendent communities even when repatriation is not required by law.","['AAP Cultural Heritage Management', 'AAP Museum Studies']",Krieger School of Arts and Sciences Advanced Academic Programs,3.00,

Models of the term structure of interest rates, spot rates and, the forward rate curve are treated; derived from cash instruments (e.g., bonds and interest rates like LIBOR) as well as from derivatives (such as Eurodollar futures and swaps). Principles of static, discrete, continuous and dynamic probabilistic models for derivative analysis (including the Weiner process, Ito’s Lemma, and an introduction to risk-neutral valuation) are applied to develop the 
binomial tree approach to option valuation, the Black-ScholesMerton differential equation, and the Black-Scholes formulas for option pricing.

Although we hear a lot about machine learning, artificial intelligence is a much broader field with many different aspects. In this course, we focus on three of those aspects: reasoning, optimization, and pattern recognition. Traditionally, the first was covered under “Symbolic AI” or “Good Old Fashioned AI” and the latter two were covered under “Numeric AI” (or more specifically, “Connectionist AI” or “Machine Learning”). However, despite the many successes of machine learning algorithms, practitioners are increasingly realizing that complicated AI systems need algorithms from all three aspects. This approach falls under the ironic heading “Hybrid AI”. In this course, the foundational algorithms of AI are presented in an integrated fashion emphasizing Hybrid AI. The topics covered include state space search, local search, example based learning, model evaluation, adversarial search, constraint satisfaction problems, logic and reasoning, expert systems, rule based ML, Bayesian networks, planning, reinforcement learning, regression, logistic regression, and artificial neural networks (multi-layer perceptrons).

Summer 2022,,['Online'],81,Agile Systems Engineering,"The development of large, complex software-intensive hardware systems has become extremely challenging for systems engineering. For example, automotive designs are now incorporating more than a hundred interconnected individual integrated control units (ICU), each designed to sense environmental factors, both internal and external to the system, and precisely control electro-mechanical devices, all of which are then networked together with the outside world: collectively this evolving technical domain is called a cyber-physical system (CPS). CPS physical and software mechanisms are deeply entwined, operating on dissimilar spatial and temporal scales that exhibit emergent, individually distinct behaviors, and in some systems can include autonomy and the ability to learn. This tight coupling between hardware components and their information-driven software functionality creates an environment of adaptive complexity requiring deliberate, incremental learning intervals with strong feedback throughout the system’s development and sustainment lifecycle. This need for continuous learning, and adapting to this learning, is challenging classic systems engineering principles and processes to incorporate new ideas and methods. Systems design and development organizations are turning to a broad set of Agile and Lean methods to manage risk and uncertainty associated with such complexity: the challenge will be in adapting, transforming and extending classic, proven systems engineering methods in order to achieve the same level of disciplined process and delivered value routinely experienced in more traditional projects. This course involves highly-collaborative teamwork requiring at least eight (8) fully-synchronous Zoom-based conferences in order to present student work as a team: meetings are typically two-hours in length and are designed to be highly-engaged, spirited discussions between students and the instructor(s).",['PE Systems Engineering'],Whiting School of Engineering for Professionals,3.00,

The two great wars in Europe were total, unambiguous, and definitive. Warfare today appears ambiguous, murky, confusing, never ending and politically complicated—especially for the legalistic United States. Warfare today is a combination of low intensity conflict (often not violent conflict) and a fight over information via cyberspace – especially over ‘narratives’ that sway public opinion. The great powers specifically fight and stay in this early stage of warfare of cyberspace operations, information operations, and limited (or no) kinetic conflict, careful never to escalate to state-on-state war. This course will examine Russian hybrid warfare, Chinese ‘coercive gradualism,’ and how non-kinetic warfare (Information Operations, cyberspace operations) takes place and will likely remain the principal focus of national security policy today.","['SA Conflict Management', 'SA Security, Strategy, and Statecraft', 'SA Strategic Studies', 'SA Technology and Culture']",Nitze School of Advanced International Studies,4.00,

This policy sphere is defined in a broad sense—from nation states, to guerrillas and insurgencies, to organized crime, gangs, traffickers, that is, all enemies of the state. The main lens of analysis is the study of the multiple strategies that the US has implemented to confront the evolving conflict and security challenges in Latin America: some debatably successful like Plan Colombia, and others less so, such as the interventions in Nicaragua. The lack of economic opportunity, rampant corruption, weak rule of law and fragile government institutions continue to riddle Latin America and serve as migration factors. Newer initiatives such as the Merida Initiative, the Central American Regional Security Initiative (CARSI) and the Alliance for Prosperity are also analyzed to learn from the past and the present to address shortfalls and potential solutions in a region beleaguered by insecurity and violence, in spite of the absence of international wars.","['SA Development, Climate, and Sustainability', 'SA Latin American Studies Program', 'SA Strategic Studies', 'SA The Americas']",Nitze School of Advanced International Studies,4.00,
