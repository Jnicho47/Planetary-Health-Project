Summer 2025,,['Homewood Campus'],21,Decoding College Writing,"This course examines three broad types of writing students will encounter at and beyond
Hopkins: narrative writing, analytical writing, and technical writing. Each has its own
implications within the walls of JHU, from research papers to creative projects, but each will
extend to the opportunities students pursue outside of academia. Above all, this course
demystifies the idea that some writers just “have it” by decoding the processes that lead to
great writing and building students’ confidence in written expression to carry forward into their
studies and professional pursuits. Offered in summers only.","['AS Summer and Intersession Programs', 'AS Writing Program']",Krieger School of Arts and Sciences,3.00,Approval Required

Summer 2025,,['Online'],41,"Population Genomics: Evolution, Extinction & Disease","Population genomics is the study of the structure, function, and variability of the entire genetic complement of organisms considered on a population scale. By examining how gene variants change in structure and frequency in populations over time, we can study the process of evolution and how it contributes to biodiversity and the formation of new species; this information can be used to increase the efficacy of conservation efforts. By studying gene variants underlying diseases at the scale of populations, we can better diagnose complex polygenic diseases like cancer. This course introduces the fundamentals of population genomics and provides an overview of the subfields of evolutionary genomics, conservation genomics, and medical genomics.

Summer 2025,,['Online'],85,Revolutionary Minds: Cognitive Studies and Romantic-Era Literature,"The Romantic era of literature, spanning about 1780-1840, obsessed over revolution: political revolutions, philosophical revolutions, and artistic revolutions. They often came to believe that the way to achieve these revolutions was, at least in part, a revolution of the mind. Breakthrough science of the era, combined with the Haitian and French Revolutions and the ethical and psychological questions prompted by abolition and the settler-colonial revolutions in the Americas, led writers across the globe to openly speculate on the nature and limits of freedom, the imagination, and human potential, as well as explore the nature of thinking through poetry and prose. As such, this era has proved an especially rich one for what has been called cognitive literary studies: the careful, selective use of the insights of cognitive science to interpret these explorations. Through this approach, we will not only see how Romanticism prefigured many insights cognitive studies has proven, but see how Romanticism’s urgent questions about revolt, oppression, and liberation challenge further cross-disciplinary inquiries into the mind.","['AS English', 'AS Summer and Intersession Programs']",Krieger School of Arts and Sciences,3.00,Canceled

Summer 2025,,['Homewood Campus'],21,Introduction to Neuroplasticity and Neurology,"Recent scientific evidence shows that our brain has a great deal of malleability at any age and that our lifestyle choices play an important role in shrinking or growing different parts of our brain. Factors such as poor sleep, obesity, anxiety, and poor diet lead to accumulating shrinkage in the brain while even three months of exercise, brain training, meditation, and optimal sleep can grow the brain. You can learn to apply these new discoveries into your day-to-day life in order to improve your memory, attention, organizational skills, and overall brain vitality. Much of your learning in this course will happen during classes. Each lecture is followed by a 10-minute engaging and fun discussion session to make sure you have grasped the main concepts for that presentation.","['AS Neuroscience', 'AS Summer and Intersession Programs']",Krieger School of Arts and Sciences,3.00,Waitlist Only

The Polish General Charter of Jewish Liberties (1264) granted religious and legal autonomy to Jews, while the Warsaw Confederation (1573) guaranteed freedom of worship to all free persons within Poland-Lithuania. We will study the legislation that provided liberties and protection from persecution to members of different religious communities. 
We will also examine the relationships between these communities, investigating how their close proximity influenced shared or contested geographical spaces, such as places of worship and cemeteries, competition for resources, and efforts to establish religiously homogeneous “towns” or districts. Our study will include buildings, artworks, and artifacts created by these communities, tracing mutual influences and patterns of representation.","['AS History', 'AS Summer and Intersession Programs']",Krieger School of Arts and Sciences,1.00,Closed

This course will explore one of the primary questions that threads through both disciplines: what is art? Is art representation? Is art expression? Is art only art in virtue of its context? Maybe art is a social and political tool? This class will begin its exploration through the historical perspectives of some of the great philosophers of the Western World, such as Plato and Hume, and work our way towards more contemporary views by philosophers such Arthur Danto and bell hooks. Beyond the chronology of art, this course will cover perspectives on “not art” art, art that (some argue) has been wrongly excluded from the dominant Western canon, such as craft and folk art.","['AS Philosophy', 'AS Summer and Intersession Programs']",Krieger School of Arts and Sciences,3.00,Canceled

What obligations, if any, do we have to future generations, other species, or ecosystems? In what ways, if any, does our impact on the environment constitute injustice? What should we do as individuals – should we just focus on political change or should we also make radical changes in our own lifestyles? What are appropriate forms of activism – is violent or destructive action ever justified to prevent disasters? Can environmental catastrophe be avoided within capitalism?

We will examine the extent to which it is possible to describe, theorize, and make visible how political power operates, and power's relationship to authority, knowledge, truth, and political freedom. A strong tradition of political thought argues that people's consent is what makes political power legitimate. But what if one of the most insidious workings of power is its ability to prevent us from telling the difference between consent and coercion? Can power allow certain authorities to effectively brainwash people? If so, does that mean that those who obey authority should no longer be held politically responsible for their actions? Does the coercive power of norms and conformity prevent any robust practice of freedom? What role (if any) should state power play in negotiating questions of morality, religion and sexuality? Lastly, we will be haunted by a related question: can political theories of power make people free, or are those theories implicated in the very coercion they profess to oppose? Classes will be a combination of lectures, critical discussions/debates, film screenings and presentations. Throughout the term, you will sharpen your ability to formulate coherent written and spoken arguments by organizing and supporting your thoughts in a persuasive manner. An important part of this skill will include the ability to wrestle with complex and controversial political problems that lack any single answer. The stakes of these problems will be brought to life by the political examples we will study, and made legible by looking through the theoretical lenses of diverse thinkers.","['AS Political Science', 'AS Summer and Intersession Programs']",Krieger School of Arts and Sciences,3.00,Canceled

This introductory course explores how the brain’s structure, electrical activity, and chemical signals shape everything from memory, motivation and decision-making. We’ll break down complex topics like neurotransmitters and neural circuits, showing how they connect to everyday experiences like learning, emotions and sleep. As you move through the course, you’ll learn how we study the biology underlying behavior using techniques like neuroimaging. You'll also see how these methods are applied in the real world — powering innovations in mental health, neurotechnology, marketing, and design. Along the way, you’ll complete weekly quizzes to reinforce your understanding, and apply your knowledge through short assignments.

McIver, preface to Wives, Widows, Mistresses and Nuns in Early Modern Italy). Drawing upon a consideration of both current research and primary sources, this course will investigate the role women played as the makers, the commissioners, and the subjects of art in Italy during the period from ca. 1250-1600. Among other issues, we will examine the constraints that limited women’s contribution to the arts in this period when women’s participation in public life were quite circumscribed, as well as the various means they found to overcome them. We will investigate what types of women were able to become artists. We will learn what categories of women were most likely to commission art, and what kinds of art they generally commissioned. Lastly, we will examine portraits of women, to understand what these representations tell us about the view of women in Renaissance society. Students will develop their own critical positions on the issues through a close reading of both texts and works of art, participation in online discussions, and in several substantial writing assignments.",['AAP Liberal Arts'],Krieger School of Arts and Sciences Advanced Academic Programs,3.00,Closed

The history of fakes, lies, and forgeries transcends human history and encompasses nearly every discipline within the liberal Arts, from literature, art, and philosophy, to history, religion, and archaeology. Human civilization has been filling gaps in the historical record and inventing alternative narratives for all sorts of reasons: political, commercial, evangelical, and personal. This course examines this dark undercurrent within human achievement across historical time, exploring specific examples of historical and literary forgeries that date from the biblical Flood to the future Apocalypse. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p>We will exploring the textual traditions of false archaeological discoveries and fabricated epigraphic fragments from classical antiquity, manufactured time capsules bearing pagan prophecies of the coming of Jesus, fake “illuminations” of Christopher Columbus and Joan of Arc, preposterous accounts of the world’s great “travel liars,” and even look at books from Shakespeare’s own library bearing his personal “annotations.” In the process, we will learn that history’s fakes and forgeries are also, in part, creative and imaginative enterprises that require considerable knowledge, creativity, and even inspiration, to pull them off effectively. At every stage this on-line course will draw upon the riches of JHU’s own Bibliotheca Fictiva, the world’s premier rare book and manuscript research collection dedicated to literary forgeries across the millennia. <o:p></o:p></span></p>",['AAP Liberal Arts'],Krieger School of Arts and Sciences Advanced Academic Programs,3.00,Closed

Throughout the literary history of the Eastern European region, writers of poems, novels, stories, and plays have created work that understands politics to be as important an aspect of the human experience as religion, love, poverty, or death. Poland, in particular, has plowed this field. This Polish literary tradition of speaking truth to power stems in part from the number of times the country has been governed or occupied by totalitarian or autocratic forces. Many of the country’s artists have spoken against those oppressions through their work. In the Czech Republic, Russia, Ukraine, and other countries, the history is similar, and so is the literary tradition. Now, as autocracy spreads in the contemporary world, the rise of literary arts that confront absolute power is seeing a resurgence. But how to do that without becoming didactic, without resorting to cut-out characters or contrived plots, without trafficking in a kind of rebellious propaganda? How has literary art in Central and Eastern Europe challenged autocratic rule in subversive or obvious ways while remaining true to itself as art? And what are the risks for the writer? What are the moral obligations? Students in this residency course will, over eight days, come to understand the ways that literary artists assert their objections to autocratic rule while staying true to their craft to create lasting works of art.

This Polish literary tradition of speaking truth to power stems in part from the number of times the country has been governed or occupied by totalitarian or autocratic forces. Many of the country’s artists have spoken against those oppressions through their work. In the Czech Republic, Russia, Ukraine, and other countries, the history is similar, and so is the literary tradition. Now, as autocracy spreads in the contemporary world, the rise of literary arts that confront absolute power is seeing a resurgence. But how to do that without becoming didactic, without resorting to cut-out characters or contrived plots, without trafficking in a kind of rebellious propaganda? How has literary art in Central and Eastern Europe challenged autocratic rule in subversive or obvious ways while remaining true to itself as art? And what are the risks for the writer? What are the moral obligations? Students in this residency course will, over eight days, come to understand the ways that literary artists assert their objections to autocratic rule while staying true to their craft to create lasting works of art. In this course–through guest lectures, discussions, writing exercises, and readings–students will explore how politics and art mix, and where, how, and why they might find footing in that locus.",['AAP Writing'],Krieger School of Arts and Sciences Advanced Academic Programs,3.00,Closed

Summer 2025,,"['Off site (Not JHU)', 'Online']",91,Science and Global Conflict,"This course explores the central role that science and scientists play in the most important global conflicts of our time. We'll study the nuclear science of the Cold War era and how Cold War science continues to shape today’s global conflicts — the war in Ukraine, first and foremost. We'll look at how scientific ingenuity led to global warming and ecological destruction and also at how science can bring about policy solutions that resolve conflicts between competing nations. We’ll look at how new technologies, such as drones and cyberwarfare operations, have changed how wars are fought and the dangerous implications of these new weapons.

At every step of the way, as in all Science Writing courses, we’ll approach these topics through the lens of the science writer. We’ll explore the many different ways journalists can write about global conflicts and meet with war correspondents who have covered wars on the front lines. Perhaps most important of all, as we learn how to cover global conflicts, we’ll also learn how to tell human stories, from the harrowing accounts of soldiers suffering from PTSD, to the struggles of families living in war zones.

Poland, situated precariously between East and West, is an ideal setting for this residency.  Krakow is less than a thousand kilometers from the Ukrainian border, and the city still bears the scars of the Soviet era. But Krakow has also emerged as a modern Western city, a home to leading scientific institutes (Jagiellonian University, Krakow University of Technology) and centers for international diplomacy (Centre for International Studies and Development).

Summer 2025,,['Online'],81,Introduction to Financial Derivatives,"This is the first of a two-course sequence devoted to the mathematical modeling of securities and the markets in which they are created and exchanged. The basic cash, hybrid, and derivative instruments are reviewed and set in a rigorous mathematical context. This includes equities, bonds, options, forwards, futures, and swaps, as well as their dealer, overthe-counter, and exchange environment. Models of the term structure of interest rates, spot rates and, the forward rate curve are treated; derived from cash instruments (e.g., bonds and interest rates like LIBOR) as well as from derivatives (such as Eurodollar futures and swaps). Principles of static, discrete, continuous and dynamic probabilistic models for derivative analysis (including the Weiner process, Ito’s Lemma, and an introduction to risk-neutral valuation) are applied to develop the 
binomial tree approach to option valuation, the Black-ScholesMerton differential equation, and the Black-Scholes formulas for option pricing.

Summer 2025,,['Online'],81,Ethics in Biomedical Engineering Research and Management,"Bioengineering focuses on the development and application of new technologies in biology and medicine. These technologies often have powerful effects on living systems at the microscopic and macroscopic level. They can provide great benefit to society, but they also can be used in dangerous or damaging ways. These effects may be positive or negative, and so it is critical that bioengineers understand the basic principles of ethics when thinking about how the technologies they develop can and should be applied. On a personal level, every bioengineer should understand the basic principles of ethical behavior in the professional setting. The goal of this semester course is to present the issues of professional conduct in the practice of engineering, research, publication, public and private disclosures, and in managing professional and financial conflicts. The course seeks to teach these concepts through didactic presentations, case studies, presentations of methods for problem solving in ethical matters, and classroom debates on contemporary ethical issues. Investigation of cases includes documentation of students’ initial thoughts on issues, then systematic reflection on these thoughts through introduction of multiple perspectives, thought papers and in-class discussions.

Summer 2025,,['Online'],81,Plasma Physics,"This course is an introduction to the physical processes that govern the “fourth state of matter”, also known as plasma. Plasma physics is the study of ionized gas, which is the state of the matter for 99.9% of the apparent universe, from astrophysical plasmas, to the solar wind and Earth’s radiation belts and ionosphere. Plasma phenomena are also relevant to energy generation by controlled thermonuclear fusion. The challenge of plasma physics comes from the fact that many plasma properties result from the long-range Coulomb interaction, and therefore are collective properties that involve many particles simultaneously. Topics to be covered during class include motion of charged particles in electric and magnetic fields, dynamics of fully ionized plasma from both microscopic and macroscopic points of view, magneto-hydrodynamics, equilibria, waves, instabilities, applications to fusion devices, ionospheric, and space physics. .",['PE Applied Physics'],Whiting School of Engineering for Professionals,3.00,Open
Summer 2025,,['Online'],81,Chaos and Its Applications,"The course will introduce students to the basic concepts of nonlinear physics, dynamical system theory, and chaos. These concepts will be studied by examining the behavior of fundamental model systems that are modeled by ordinary differential equations and, sometimes, discrete maps. Examples will be drawn from physics, chemistry, and engineering. Some mathematical theory is necessary to develop the material. Practice through concrete examples will help to develop the geometric intuition necessary for work on nonlinear systems. Students conduct numerical experiments using provided software, which allows for interactive learning. Prerequisite(s): Mathematics through ordinary differential equations. Familiarity with MATLAB is helpful.

In the last decade, transformer models dominated the world of natural language processing (NLP) and have become the conventional model in almost all NLP tasks. However, developments of transformers in computer vision were still lagging. In recent years, applications of transformers started to accelerate. This course will introduce the attention mechanism and the transformer networks by understanding the pros and cons of this architecture. The importance of unsupervised or semi-supervised pre-training for the transformer architectures, as well as their impact for developments of large-scale foundation model. This will pave the way to introduce transformers in computer vision. Additionally, the course aims to extend the attention idea into the 2D spatial domain for image datasets, investigate how convolution can be generalized using self-attention within the encoder-decoder meta architecture, analyze how this generic architecture is almost the same in image as in text and NLP, which makes transformers a generic function approximator, and discuss the channel and spatial attention, local vs. global attention among other topics. Furthermore, we will also study different neural architectures that are designed for several fundamental tasks in computer vision, namely, classification, object detection, semantic and instance segmentation. In particular, vision transformer, pyramid vision transformer, shifted window transformer (Swin), Detection Transformer (DETR), segmentation transformer (SETR), and many others will be explored.

Summer 2025,,['Online'],91,Political Risk: Analyzing and Managing Challenges in a World of Growing Disorder,"Politics affects risk on many levels (e.g., international, national, regional, and local), and is the result of the interaction of many different elements. In this course, we start by examining some basic issues with regard to risk analysis as well as why forecasts often fall short before examining three broad issues: country structural fragility; problems with collective action policymaking; and operational breakdowns. The first looks at how the sociopolitical and institutional dynamics of a country affects its evolution. The second looks at how the policy formulation process works and why it often yields a less than ideal result. The third looks at the challenges of implementation. As such, the class focuses more on the risks that face countries than on how particular risks might impact corporations or NGOs, though the latter is also examined. The two types of risks are related but are not identical (e.g., regulatory changes may be good for a country, but bad for a company or NGO). We conclude by examining how to prioritize and mitigate risk. Each class aims to provide students with a set of frameworks to think about and assess these issues. Students all get a chance to work on case studies to develop their skills.

Summer 2025,,['Online'],91,"The Chinese People’s Liberation Army and China’s Search for Military Power and Security, 1949-Present","This course is designed to provide an overview of the development of the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) from the establishment of the People’s Republic of China (PRC) in 1949 to the present, and to enable students to analyze Chinese military capabilities, evaluate the ongoing modernization of the PLA, and assess the implications for regional and global security.  The course will build a framework for analyzing Chinese military and security developments by focusing on a number of theoretical and practical issues, including issues such as the problems of assessing foreign military transformation in peacetime; the strengths and weaknesses of different approaches to assessing the capabilities of the PLA (such as by tracking progress in PLA capabilities over time, comparing contemporary PLA capabilities with those of the U.S. military, and evaluating the PLA’s ability to perform its missions); key events in the history of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA), primarily since the establishment of the People’s Republic of China (PRC) in 1949; modernization of China’s military hardware including conventional ground, air, and naval forces, nuclear and conventional missile forces, and space and counter-space capabilities;and the implications of China’s expanding national security interests for the future missions and capabilities of the Chinese military.","['SA China', 'SA MASCI', 'SA Security, Strategy, and Statecraft']",Nitze School of Advanced International Studies,4.00,Closed
