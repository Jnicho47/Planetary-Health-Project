Students should be prepared to write and read scripts, offer feedback to their fellow students, shoot and edit videos, and create career goal maps and resumes. (Note: some level of basic shooting and video editing acumen will be necessary, as a short film deliverable will be required for successful course completion.) By the end of the course students will understated the basic mechanics of the entertainment industry and where they might like to fall within it, and they will walk away with a complete short film they've written and directed.","['AS Film and Media Studies', 'AS Summer and Intersession Programs']",Krieger School of Arts and Sciences,3.00,

social choice theory, weighted voting systems, apportionment methods, and gerrymandering. In
the search for ideal ways to make certain kinds of political decisions, a lot of wasted effort could
be averted if mathematics could determine that finding such an ideal were actually possible in the
first place. The course will analyze data from recent US elections as well as provide historical
context to modern discussions in politics, culminating in a mathematical analysis of the US
Electoral College. Case studies, future implications, and comparisons to other governing bodies
outside the US will be used to apply the theory of the course. Students will use Microsoft Excel to

Summer 2021,,['Online'],85,Global Political Thought in the Age of Revolution,"The late 18th century witnessed several political upheavals that reshaped global politics. The American, French, and Haitian revolutions profoundly transformed the concepts and conduct of politics at a transnational scale. They reshaped empires, introduced new ideas of freedom, invented practices of popular sovereignty, and formed novel rituals of political belonging. Their revolutionary violence was also coupled with reaction, circumscribed claims to universal liberty, and the retrenchment of slavery, racial hierarchy, and global inequality. This course explores this dynamic of revolution and reaction in this epoch-making thirty-year period in global history through the concepts of empire, freedom, and violence. How did empire, slavery and capitalism shape the contours of global politics in the age of revolutions? How were ideas of freedom circumscribed by the imperial practices of politics? How were universal conceptions of freedom shaped in and against colonial projects of rule? How fundamental was violence to the project of revolution? What purpose did it serve in the project of liberation? We conclude our course by examining the politics of memory to inquire into how these revolutions shape our present and whether revolution might still be desirable or even possible today.","['AS International Studies', 'AS Political Science']",Krieger School of Arts and Sciences,3.00,

We will read both classical and contemporary scholarship on the concepts in political theory and comparative politics and topics will include the nation-state, national identity, statelessness, nationalism and citizenship in postcolonial contexts, as well as the politics of immigration. As we go along, we will analyse some historical and contemporary empirical applications of these debates in different countries ranging from Korea and India to Algeria and Japan. We will also consider the implications of the current rise of right-wing nationalism on citizenship policies.","['AS International Studies', 'AS Political Science']",Krieger School of Arts and Sciences,3.00,
Summer 2021,,['Online'],85,Capitalist Origins and a History of the Present,"The world we inhabit today is thoroughly characterized by the imperatives and tendencies of capitalism. Major problems of our time—extreme inequality in income, wealth, and access to basic goods and services; overpolicing and racist policing; the degradation of non-human nature, which increasingly reacts to human attempts to dominate it; and the constant expansion of oppressive state power both abroad and domestically—are impossible to understand completely without paying attention to capitalism’s constant demand for expansion and its arbitrary segmentation of the working class. This course begins by first grappling with how we should conceive of capitalism as a “mode of production” before turning to the debates over its origins: what was the relationship between the development of capitalism in its “classic” (English) form and the broader trade networks that preceded it? Finally, we turn to the development of capitalism in the United States, emphasizing the capitalist character of both the North and the South and the dependence of domestic production on international trade networks before turning to the long-run development of an American “industrial working class.” Finally, we conclude with a discussion of these themes in relation to present-day issues: the financialization of the U.S. economy; Trump’s election and the waning hold of “progressive neoliberalism”; the severe workplace treatment of undocumented immigrants; and the “escalating plunder” of Congress’s COVID bailout. Together, we will seek to gain a better understanding of how our own worlds are embedded within these larger capitalist processes and are constantly subordinated to the demands of capitalist reproduction.","['AS International Studies', 'AS Political Science']",Krieger School of Arts and Sciences,3.00,

Summer 2021,,['Online'],86,Writing the Unreal,"In this course, we will explore the effects and advantages of introducing fantastical or science fictional elements to storytelling. We will consider mythmaking, fairy tale, and hauntings, looking at the ways in which these tools can bring us closer to the truths of real experiences. We will experiment with turning STEM subjects or ideas into story, using fiction to envision the implications of different types of science and technology. For each topic, we will discuss the theory and context of the form, read a variety of stories that fall within each category, do in-class writing exercises to isolate different elements, and finish the week with a longer writing assignment. The final week of the class will be devoted to workshopping a revision or extension of one of these longer pieces. Over the course of the five weeks, students will have the opportunity to meet several of the authors via Zoom to discuss their stories and ask questions about the writing process. Students will be expected to prepare questions for the authors in advance of these meetings.","['AS Summer and Intersession Programs', 'AS Writing Seminars']",Krieger School of Arts and Sciences,3.00,

Summer 2021,,['Online'],88,Star Trek Music- The Franchise Frontier,"Music defines the Star Trek experience. Through their continued reuse and repetition, Star Trek’s many musical themes go beyond their original audiovisual frameworks to operate as learned musical-cultural texts. As Star Trek has expanded its content into a myriad of installments and media platforms, this musical symbolism has proved vital in articulating both these differences and “sameness.”

This online, asynchronous course uses Star Trek’s music as a tool to investigate musical branding and the creation of meaning in the media we consume every day. Through close viewings—and listenings—of film, television episodes, video games, computer games, commercials, and other media, we will explore the meaning(s) these media construct and acquire as they are re-used and re-purposed in audiovisual contexts. Your work will include studying media clips, television episodes, and some feature-length films; short readings in which we interact with both current and classic scholarly literature; regular discussion posts and responses to our content; a weekly reflection journal of short posts; and a final paper/project on a Star Trek music topic of your choice (1500 words). In so doing, we will hone your analytical skills by learning to critically evaluate filmic media and craft arguments about the roles of music/sound in film.","['AS Music', 'AS Summer and Intersession Programs']",Krieger School of Arts and Sciences,3.00,

The thinkers we will discuss can be thought of as engaged in what Robert Hutchins called a ""great conversation"" across the centuries on the central questions of political philosophy. These questions include: What are the purposes of government? What is the best form of government? How are justice and liberty best realized in a political system? What are rights - and where do they come from? What is sovereignty and in whom does it reside? What principles make political authority legitimate? Is disobedience to political authority ever justified? In many ways these questions are perennial ones, as relevant in our own time as in the distant past. Moreover the divergent systems of thought developed to answer these questions continue to shape much of contemporary political life - e.g. democracy, constitutionalism, liberalism, socialism, and conservatism. Among the political philosophers who will be examined are Plato, Aristotle, Augustine, Thomas Aquinas, Machiavelli, John Locke, Edmund Burke, Thomas Hobbes, Jean Jacques Rousseau, Friedrich Nietzsche, Karl Marx, Hannah Arendt, and Leo Strauss.

Deep Ecology asks deep questions and aims to bring about long-range goals in moving away from anthropocentrism to ecocentrism, calling for a major paradigm shift in perception, values, and lifestyles. Planetary and human survival is at stake due to climate change — this is humanity’s global ultimate concern. Scientists, environmental activists, and representatives of humanities agree that we need a new paradigm shift, that it is unsustainable to treat the living earth organism as an infinite resource of “energy.” Western environmental practices have been based on anthropocentric view of nature where humans occupy the top of the hierarchy in the chain of life. There is an urgent need for a new environmental ethic that will fundamentally reorient humans in their thinking and relating to the natural environment. The course examines cross-cultural perspectives of environmental ethics that are rooted in Western/scientific, Eastern, and Indigenous worldviews and religions.

Summer 2021,,['Online'],81,The Business of Museums,"Museums are stewards of cultural patrimony, disseminators of knowledge, and agents of civic and social awareness. They are community icons, places of respite, economic drivers, and centers of informal education and public engagement. In serving these functions, museums must deal within a hyper-competitive entertainment and commercial environment. While they serve the greater good, they must function as businesses. As nonprofits, they cultivate financial and community support from individuals and donors. They also rely on fees, grants, sponsorships, retail operations and other strategies to survive. This course is a journey through the business side of the museum world. Students will explore the range, fundamentals, and subtleties of the museum world including mission, governance, programming, management, finance, fundraising, public relations, legal and ethical issues, technologies, risk management, audience engagement, leadership, and strategic planning, all in the context of current news stories and events.","['AAP Cultural Heritage Management', 'AAP Museum Studies']",Krieger School of Arts and Sciences Advanced Academic Programs,3.00,

No longer are museums measured and judged solely by their internal resources—collections, endowments, facilities, and staff—but rather by the external benefits and value they create for individuals and communities. Growing numbers of museums are learning to make their organizations more meaningful and relevant by involving their communities in ongoing planning and decision-making. They are reframing museum activities to focus on what matters to their communities. By getting involved in community challenges and developing new partnerships, they are identifying underserved audiences and creating memorable visitor experiences. As museums begin this journey towards community engagement, they are initiating and facilitating social change and moving towards social entrepreneurship. This course includes the theory and skills of community engagement, drawing on both research and practice for examples.",['AAP Museum Studies'],Krieger School of Arts and Sciences Advanced Academic Programs,3.00,
Summer 2021,,['Online'],81,"Museums, Race, and Inclusion","For over two decades, museums have been grappling with how to increase participation and engagement with community members who are historically under-engaged. By and large, the 2012 Center for the Future of Museum’s Report informs us that of the core group of museum visitors, less than 10% represent visitors of color. This course will examine the historical arch of diversity and inclusion initiatives in the field including recent activism as engineered by museum activists and change-makers of the Inclusive Museum Movement. We will explore and define discourses of participation within museum scholarship. This course will use interdisciplinary pedagogies such as Critical Race Theory and Social Inclusion Theory as informative frameworks to help us interrogate our current museum praxis, the museum space, and how invisible social structures such as institutional racism, privilege, and oppression impact our understanding of terms such as diversity, inclusion, equity, and access. In this course, we will explore why race matters in museums and seek to create and identify new discourses on diversity and inclusion for a more vibrant, 21st century museum social ecosystem.","['AAP Cultural Heritage Management', 'AAP Museum Studies']",Krieger School of Arts and Sciences Advanced Academic Programs,3.00,
Summer 2021,,['Online'],81,Museum Evaluation and Audience Research,"This course explores audience research and evaluation theory, methodologies, and practical implementation in museums and similar environments. The class explores the three main stages of research and evaluation - front end, formative and summative - and what can be achieved at each stage, with a focus on exhibition and program evaluation. Each semester a museum client presents a real project; in small groups students develop clear research questions, an evaluation plan, an interview tool and an observation tool, all in conjunction with the client. A final presentation ensures the client’s evaluation needs are met and workable tools have been created. Students also spend time developing individual projects for their own museums, or museums in their communities. Emphasis is given on evaluating the holistic visitor experience, examining what is working and what is not - educationally, physically, and socially. This course is useful to all museum professionals, in any role within a museum, whether you plan to conduct, oversee, or in any way participate in audience research and evaluation.","['AAP Cultural Heritage Management', 'AAP Museum Studies']",Krieger School of Arts and Sciences Advanced Academic Programs,3.00,

Summer 2021,,['Online'],81,Practice of Public History,"Twenty-first-century public history has expanded beyond the simple definition of ""history outside the classroom” to include almost any effort to develop and communicate history-related content, from museums and historic houses to movies and social media, to inform, and even influence, audiences. This course provides a comprehensive overview of public history as a modern, engaging field of practice, with a skill-building focus on digital storytelling as the key tool for reaching existing audiences and building new ones. It is now a heavily democratic field in the sense that it can be practiced anywhere, by anyone — and therein lies additional challenges for museum and public history professionals. Consequently, we will cover the fundamental elements of practicing public history — including fundraising, governance, interpretation, and countering false narratives — while also introducing students to the process of digital storytelling, which merges the strength of visual and audio media with the power of narrative storytelling to produce informative and persuasive history-related content. By the end of the course, students will have a working knowledge of the ways that modern public history practitioners understand their roles and leave with a toolkit of new media skills to help them shape their own careers.","['AAP Cultural Heritage Management', 'AAP Museum Studies']",Krieger School of Arts and Sciences Advanced Academic Programs,3.00,

Summer 2021,,['Online'],81,NAGPRA: Repatriation as Compliance or Ethical Practice,"In the United States, the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA) outlines a process by which government agencies (and those who receive government funding) must return human remains and sacred objects to those who claim them. Repatriation is a complicated process because it means something different in almost every case. One of its earliest claims took 20-years to resolve. In 2017, the Ancient One was returned to the tribes of the Columbia River for reburial after DNA tests proved the relationship that tribes had claimed all along. But now reproductions of the Ancient One’s skull are being sold by a company that holds the copyright. When those from outside the culture to which he was returned can examine and/or profit from a replica, the distinction between compliance with the law and the ethics of return is clear. Outside of the United States, few repatriation laws exist and many argue that institutions like The British Museum are the best places to protect world heritage. Is providing care of and access to human remains and cultural objects preferable over returning heritage to those from which it was taken? In this course, we examine repatriation claims around the globe in order to critique NAGPRA and establish a compliance toolkit. Where NAGPRA doesn’t apply, heritage professionals can use the successes and failures of past repatriations, and a firm grounding in ethics, to make repatriation decisions. Nothing in NAGPRA prohibits practitioners from exceeding its scope and seeking out opportunities to build relationships with descendent communities even when repatriation is not required by law.","['AAP Cultural Heritage Management', 'AAP Museum Studies']",Krieger School of Arts and Sciences Advanced Academic Programs,3.00,

Summer 2021,,['Online'],81,Risk Management Analytics,"Risk management has always been in the vanguard of data analytics because risk measurement is a critical element in calculating risk/return tradeoffs. This course will examine both qualitative and quantitative analytical methods commonly used in risk management. Qualitative tools include impact/likelihood analysis; event and fault trees; threats, vulnerability, and consequences (TVC); and failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA). However, a key lesson in risk management is that what gets measured gets managed. As a result, a major part of the course will focus on quantitative tools, including modeling and stochastic simulations. We will use the @Risk software to build realistic risk models, including one in assessing project management risks. The objective of the course is to equip students with practical tools they can apply in risk-based decision making.

Summer 2021,,['Online'],31,Financial Crises and Contagion,"What and when will the next financial crisis be? No one knows, but the past provides clues. This course takes students through the history of finance in the United States, with a focus on the last 100 years of financial bubbles, manias, and scandals, from the crash of 1929 to the thrift crisis of the 1980s; Enron and other accounting debacles; and the mortgage meltdown known as the Great Recession. Examining the upheavals is key to understanding how the landscape and laws of modern financial markets evolved and where they might be headed. <br></br>
 
With the Great Recession of 2007–2012, the United States experienced the biggest economic crisis and ensuing downturn since the crash of 1929 and Great Depression of the 1930s. While every boom-and-bust is unique, all share certain characteristics—most notably, the seemingly inexhaustible ability of humans to forget the lessons of financial history. This forgetfulness comes at great expense to society. This course provides a tour of the country’s major boom-and-bust-cycles, with a focus on last century, and particularly the last three decades, when such events became more numerous. After each debacle, laws and rules changed. Executives must know what those changes are and the reasoning behind them, but they also will have a competitive edge in recognizing future crises if they remember and understand the events underpinning those of the past.",['BU Finance'],Carey Business School,2.00,

Students are required to focus on the praxis of solutions for effective decision-making approaches for including diverse stakeholders as part of their management approach.  This course examines claims made by diverse groups along with the regulatory and government policy responses that address perceived inequity and injustice. The course will study the mechanisms that give rise to class, racial, ableism and other kinds of disparities that impact environmental decision-making which can be barriers to achieving the sustainability development goals that broadly involve these stakeholders. This includes the study of affected constituents, communities, industry, government, activists, policy makers, and scholars, allowing students to learn about the causes and consequences of inequitable distributions of benefits and hazards. Students will learn about various methods for researching climate and energy justice issues and strategies for formulating policies and collaborating with communities. In this course, students will review theories and perspectives through case studies of Black Americans, Latinas, Asians, disability, and indigenous communities. The class will focus mainly on the United States but will include aspects of international issues and perspectives through assignments. There will be flexible options for students to participate in game simulations on climate justice and sustainability issues and when possible, include international participants and guest speakers from these diverse communities.","['PE Climate, Energy, and Environmental Sustainability', 'PE Environmental Planning and Management']",Whiting School of Engineering for Professionals,3.00,

Summer 2021,,['Online'],81,Agile Systems Engineering,"The development of large, complex software-intensive hardware systems has become extremely challenging for systems engineering. For example, automotive designs are now incorporating more than a hundred interconnected individual integrated control units (ICU), each designed to sense environmental factors, both internal and external to the system, and precisely control electro-mechanical devices, all of which are then networked together with the outside world: collectively this evolving technical domain is called a cyber-physical system (CPS). CPS physical and software mechanisms are deeply entwined, operating on dissimilar spatial and temporal scales that exhibit emergent, individually distinct behaviors, and in some systems can include autonomy and the ability to learn. This tight coupling between hardware components and their information-driven software functionality creates an environment of adaptive complexity requiring deliberate, incremental learning intervals with strong feedback throughout the system’s development and sustainment lifecycle. This need for continuous learning, and adapting to this learning, is challenging classic systems engineering principles and processes to incorporate new ideas and methods. Systems design and development organizations are turning to a broad set of Agile and Lean methods to manage risk and uncertainty associated with such complexity: the challenge will be in adapting, transforming and extending classic, proven systems engineering methods in order to achieve the same level of disciplined process and delivered value routinely experienced in more traditional projects. This course involves highly-collaborative teamwork requiring at least eight (8) fully-synchronous Zoom-based conferences in order to present student work as a team: meetings are typically two-hours in length and are designed to be highly-engaged, spirited discussions between students and the instructor(s).",['PE Systems Engineering'],Whiting School of Engineering for Professionals,3.00,

Summer 2021,,['Online'],90,"Politics and Risk: Countries, Policies and Institutions","Politics affects risk on many levels (e.g., international, national, regional, and local), and is the result of the interaction of many different elements. In this course, we start by examining some basic issues with regard to risk analysis as well as why forecasts often fall short before examining three broad issues: country structural fragility; problems with collective action policymaking; and operational breakdowns. The first looks at how the sociopolitical and institutional dynamics of a country affects its evolution. The second looks at how the policy formulation process works and why it often yields a less than ideal result. The third looks at the challenges of implementation. As such, the class focuses more on the risks that face countries than on how particular risks might impact corporations or NGOs, though the latter is also examined. The two types of risks are related but are not identical (e.g., regulatory changes may be good for a country, but bad for a company or NGO). We conclude by examining how to prioritize and mitigate risk. Each class aims to provide students with a set of frameworks to think about and assess these issues. Students all get a chance to work on case studies to develop their skills.

Summer 2021,,['Washington DC Center'],01,Business and Human Rights: Whose Responsibility is it?,"This course is centered around three main questions: whether business should be concerned about its human rights impacts, the increasing importance of corporate human rights due diligence, and what type of remedy is available for victims of corporate abuse. Students will gain expertise on human rights related business risks and how to advise companies in a transnational business environment through role-playing exercises and case studies like the FIFA 2022 World Cup in Qatar and Apple in China. The course will focus on corporate sustainability, in light of pressures facing business at home and abroad, including their response to issues such as climate change, the COVID pandemic, and systemic racism.

The class will address the crucial role of investors, civil society and consumers, and the legal regime in rewarding (and penalizing) businesses that do not take human rights and the environment into account. By the end of the course, students will have gained advocacy writing experience from the point of view of a civil society activist, as well as a corporate change maker, and the opportunity to engage first hand with guest lecturers working on these issues.

It will focus on the increasing importance of corporate social responsibility, the creation of shared value for business, and the crucial role of the financial sector, advocacy groups and the internet in rewarding (and penalizing) businesses that do not take human rights and sustainability into account.

Summer 2021,,['Online'],50,Illicit Finance,"This course will examine the methodologies used by criminals and terrorists to raise and move money, the tools that governments use to track and stop them, and the latest developments in the field. Students will look at how illicit finance campaigns are being fought in the areas of terrorism, organized crime, human rights violations, and cyber-crime. 

The course will cover both the systemic/structural and targeted/tactical levels of the fight. At the systemic level, governments are working to lift the tide for all boats, and enhance global anti-money laundering and combating terrorist financing (AML/CFT) standards and implementation. In the targeted arena, law enforcement, intelligence, and private sector compliance officers are tracking and targeting financial flows as a means to unravel plots, uncover conspirators, and disrupt networks. At the same time, illicit actors have become more sophisticated and more resourceful in hiding and moving money. Students will learn not just what is being done but how to critically assess tools and policy efforts in the field.
