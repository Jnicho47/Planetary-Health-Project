Intersession 2020,,['Homewood Campus'],12,Making your own Plant based Burger,"Artificial meat, particularly plant-based meat substitutes, are rapidly gaining in popularity. Creating these products involves an extensive use of basic biochemistry. In this course we will review the basic biochemistry that underlies plant-based meat production and also the biochemistry at play when actual meat is cook and prepared for consumption. We will attend a cooking class to learn from a working chef how meat is prepared and what happens to meat as it is cooked. We will then take all of this knowledge into a kitchen and work to prepare our own version of artificial beef. WARNING: this class will involve the use of raw meat!

An additional course fee of $50 will be assessed all students. The fee will cover one class session of instruction by a professional chef and taught in commercial kitchen.","['AS Biology', 'AS Summer and Intersession Programs']",Krieger School of Arts and Sciences,1.00,

We will integrate these readings with a survey of Greek and Roman artistic sources featuring Medea. We will then focus on modern adaptations of the Medea myth: a novel by German author Christa Wolf as well as Pier Paolo Pasolini’s and Lars von Trier’s films dedicated to this multifaceted figure of Greek mythology. All texts will be read in translation. No knowledge of Greek or Latin required.","['AS Classics', 'AS Summer and Intersession Programs']",Krieger School of Arts and Sciences,1.00,
Intersession 2020,,['Homewood Campus'],13,"Gods, Heroes and Monsters: Mythology through the Visual Arts","From the battles of the Trojan War to the love affairs among the gods and mortals, the ancient Greeks and Romans depicted their favorite mythological episodes through visual representations. In this course, we will explore mythology through the medium of ancient art. We will use the iconography to investigate the significance of the ancient myths, which will be read in translation. Additionally, we will visit the Walters to examine the collection of mythological images in art.","['AS Classics', 'AS History of Art']",Krieger School of Arts and Sciences,1.00,
Intersession 2020,,['Homewood Campus'],13,Early Imperial Historiography: Julio-Claudian Narratives,"In this course, we shall read three works in translation in order to note how they concur, diverge, interpret, and reinterpret historical events and figures:  the /Res Gestae/ of Emperor Augustus; the /Historia/ of Velleius Paterculus; and Lucan's /Pharsalia/.  Furthermore, we will pay close attention to what images and metaphors these works employ in order to color their interpretation of history, as well as a more critical attention to their understandings of the Roman Republic and Roman Empire.","['AS Classics', 'AS Summer and Intersession Programs']",Krieger School of Arts and Sciences,1.00,
Intersession 2020,,['Homewood Campus'],13,Greek Myth and Anime: Cross-cultural Concepts of Man and Divinity,"In this course, we shall watch the anime /Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood/ (2009-10), which is set in the land of Amestris which is ruled by the Führer Bradly and the State military.  Within the state military apparatus, work the protagonists Edward and Alphonse Elric who pursue the Philosopher's stone in order to return the soul of Alphonse to his body after a terrible alchemic transmutation had gone awry. One the one hand, the anime already makes overtures to WWII Germany, while at the same time positing issues concerning the nature of the body and soul.  These same issues were discussed in WWII Germany through Philhellenic leses, and therefore, we shall read in translation Ancient Greek literature, such as Hesiod's /Theogony/, which discusses the nature of man, body, and soul.  In the process, we will begin to compare /Fullmetal Alchemist:  Brotherhood/ to Ancient Greek texts with an eye to the following questions: In what ways does /Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood/ adopt and transorm the Western Classical Tradition and Western history? How does the 'Japanese Spirit' recalibrate interpretations of the West or absorb Western ideas? What is the nature of the body and soul? Are they the same for both cultures, or are they different?","['AS Classics', 'AS Summer and Intersession Programs']",Krieger School of Arts and Sciences,1.00,

In this course, we focus on how English scientific terms derive from classical languages. You will learn to recognize, translate and use some of the most important Greek and Latin roots found in the vocabulary of the sciences and technology. In addition to expanding and consolidating your vocabulary and your knowledge of scientific terminology, you will also learn skills that will help you tackle some of the most common standardized tests, such as the GRE and the GMAT. No prior knowledge of Greek or Latin is required.","['AS Classics', 'AS Medicine, Science and the Humanities']",Krieger School of Arts and Sciences,1.00,
Intersession 2020,,['Homewood Campus'],12,Learning from their mistakes: Experimental Approaches to Language Learning,"Speaking a language is something all children learn to do, but exactly how they do it largely remains a mystery. In this course, we study several classic experiments which investigate the process of language learning. Each of these papers focuses on a type of syntactic “error” that children make between the ages of 3 and 6 years old. What can these mistakes tell us about how children are learning?  What might cause a child to say “I goed to the zoo”, “I don’t likes that”, or “What do you think who the cat chased?”? We will explore these questions and more in this course, with the goal of better understanding language and the process of learning syntax.

While previous experience in linguistics courses (such as AS.050.102 Language and Mind or AS.050.206 Bilingualism) is recommended, this course is designed to be accessible and enjoyable to anyone interested in language acquisition or child development.","['AS Cognitive Science', 'AS Summer and Intersession Programs']",Krieger School of Arts and Sciences,1.00,

What’s so appealing about Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy? What are the political, personal, and academic uses of the novel? What is the role of the fan? Over two weeks, we take a deep dive into Jane Austen’s Pride and Prejudice. From “Jane Austen Fight Club” to fanfic to songs like “Oh, Mr. Darcy” to filmic adaptation, we explore how fans keep alive an ardent love and admiration for P&P, revealing the complex relationship we have with media. 

By the end of this course, students will have practiced literary and media analysis, learning how to think critically about pop-culture, gender, sexuality, and race through an iconic text and its adaptations and afterlives.","['AS English', 'AS Summer and Intersession Programs']",Krieger School of Arts and Sciences,1.00,

Taking our cue from a Southern Christian literary imagination, we ask: What Christian past lives in a Southern present, and to what ends? We explore this indirectly by turning to real-world, Southern examples from three domains: politics, prisons, and sports. We illuminate how the framing of being ""Christ-haunted"" might interrogate the moral economies of ethics and grace, punishment and redemption, violence and salvation, which permeate these domains.","['AS Anthropology', 'AS Summer and Intersession Programs']",Krieger School of Arts and Sciences,1.00,

To do so in an entertaining (hopefully!) way, we will use episodes from Star Trek series (The Original Series, Next Generation, Deep Space Nine, etc.) to explore the complicated nature of diplomacy in (fictitious) praxis. While borne of the Cold War Great Power Competition between the US and USSR and mostly optimistic about the liberal internationalism promoted by the US, Star Trek over the years has dealt with complex social and political issues relevant to the study of IR to this day. One of the main contentions of the course is that the study of International Relations can benefit from exploring hypotheses in alternate futures. Each class meeting will be paired with one episode from a Star Trek series and students are expected to view the episode as well as complete all class readings prior to meeting. The focus of these comparisons is not to see how the IR themes covered in the syllabus play out in a contained story.

Intersession 2020,,['Homewood Campus'],13,In-Between Worlds: Absorption and Distraction in Literary Reading,"When and for what reasons are readers unable or unwilling to follow a text? Precisely these “moments of non-reading” might be “equally or more instructive” than reading itself (Agamben 78). This class therefore wants to explore the blockages and difficulties that fictional and non-fictional readers encounter.

While dealing with literature in which both reading and the failure to read are addressed, the class provides insights into different reading modes, and the relationship between text and reader through a phenomenological and post-structuralist approach. Furthermore, this seminar aims to increase self-awareness of one’s own reading behavior.

The class will consist of three different parts: a theoretical discussion of reading and reading failures, a close reading of literary examples, and an individual student project that involves a meta-analysis of a literary text of their choice. Excerpts from 20th century writers and philosophers such as Simone de Beauvoir, Roland Barthes, and Wolfgang Iser as well as reading theories by Virginia Woolf, Vladimir Nabokov, and Hermann Hesse will form the basis for our theoretical reflections. Literary examples include Robert Musil’s The Confusions of Young Master Törleß and excerpts from Anna Karenina.","['AS German & Romance Languages & Literatures', 'AS Summer and Intersession Programs']",Krieger School of Arts and Sciences,1.00,

Obtaining reliable answers benefits from two components.  First, one needs a theoretical framework used to organize the data.  Second, one needs a suitable statistical method to summarize the implications and properties of the data so as to develop an intelligible answer to the question at hand.

Unfortunately, there is no “cookbook” available that will turn an amateur into a successful professional.  So this course adopts a case-study approach by focusing on two important questions: How can one measure the degree of international capital mobility and how can one determine the extent to which a particular the exchange rate for a particular currency is misaligned.

In addition to becoming familiar with these two subjects, students develop the habit of asking two important questions for professional life: How do you know and what is the alternative?    A successful applied research project integrates these two questions into providing reliable answers.
