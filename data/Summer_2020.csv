Demystifying the Entertainment Business is a two-week online course that offers students insight into: behind-the-camera careers in the field (specifically writing, directing, producing, and developing); how to best prepare for those careers; and how to break into the industry once graduation finally comes. 
Students should be prepared to write and read scripts, offer feedback to their fellow students, shoot and edit videos, and create career goal maps and resumes. (Note: some level of basic shooting and video editing acumen will be necessary, as a short film deliverable will be required for successful course completion.) By the end of the course students will understated the basic mechanics of the entertainment industry and where they might like to fall within it, and they will walk away with a complete short film they've written and directed.","['AS Film and Media Studies', 'AS Summer and Intersession Programs']",Krieger School of Arts and Sciences,3.00,

Alongside transnational corporations, globalization also brought a myriad of illicit actors that have gained strength in the last two decades. Gangs, cartels and mafias challenge core functions of the state and oftentimes even provide public goods such as security. In this course, we will study the emergence and relevance of these actors for international politics, how they organize, become powerful and in which situations they use violence to settle disputes with states and competing organizations. In the second part of the course, we will use case studies from around the globe to understand current dynamics of criminal associations and their relationships with states, international actors and civil society.","['AS Political Science', 'AS Summer and Intersession Programs']",Krieger School of Arts and Sciences,3.00,

This course investigates these questions through a discussion of class, race, gender, sexuality, political membership, and nationality. This course will explore the recent history of identity politics in order to explain why, in our contemporary historical moment, identity categories like race, nationality, gender and sexuality are becoming intractable lines of division in the way we understand our most intimate notions of the self as well as how we enact politics today. The course will present various contemporary positions, both academic (‘culture wars’ in the 90s, intersectionality, assemblage theory, alt-right critique of ‘political correctness’, …) as well as civic (the case of Rachel Dolezal, Black Lives Matter, #MeToo, …), regarding identity politics and critically evaluate these logics both on the left and the right of the political spectrum.","['AS Political Science', 'AS Summer and Intersession Programs']",Krieger School of Arts and Sciences,3.00,

It begins with abolitionism and extends to the present-day Black Lives Matter movement. The focus will be on primary texts. Classes will be driven by student discussion, though I may give a short lecture at the beginning of class to offer historical context.

This diversity might explain why, despite the growing numbers of Latinos in the country, there is no single organization claiming to represent them and there seems to be no cohesive voting strategy. In this course, we will explore the diversity within Latinos, focusing on group formation, group-based identities, and group positions. During the US presidential campaigns in 2016, the number of podcasts focusing on Latino issues exploded. Thus, we will use them as a window into debates about political representatives and representation, racial prejudice, political preferences, and coalitions and contestation among Latinos.","['AS Political Science', 'AS Summer and Intersession Programs']",Krieger School of Arts and Sciences,3.00,

How do ideas of national identity and belonging contribute to national immigration policies? In this course, we will examine the intimate relationship between nationalism and citizenship. We will read both classical and contemporary scholarship on the concepts in political theory and comparative politics and topics will include the nation-state, national identity, statelessness, democratic citizenship, nationalism and citizenship in postcolonial contexts, as well as the politics of immigration. As we go along, we will analyze some historical and contemporary empirical applications of these debates in different countries ranging from Brazil and India to Turkey and Japan. We will also consider the implications of the current rise of right-wing nationalism on citizenship policies.","['AS Political Science', 'AS Summer and Intersession Programs']",Krieger School of Arts and Sciences,3.00,

Summer 2020,,['Homewood Campus'],21,Medical Humanitarianism,"Humanitarian organizations play life-preserving roles in global conflicts, and have front-row views of disasters ranging from the 2010 Haiti earthquake to the 2011 Fukushima tsunami in Japan.  Yet even while they provide vital assistance to millions of people in crisis, such organizations are beset by important paradoxes that hinder their capacity to create sustainable interventions.  They work to fill long-lasting needs, but are prone to moving quickly from one site to the next in search of the latest emergency.  They strive to be apolitical, yet are invariably influenced by the geopolitical agendas of global powers.  How do such contradictions arise, and what is their impact upon millions of aid recipients around the world?   Drawing on case studies from South Sudan to Haiti, this course addresses these contradictions by exploring how and why medical aid organizations attempt, and sometimes fail, to reconcile short-term goals, such as immediate life-saving, with long-term missions, such as public health programs and conflict resolution initiatives.","['AS International Studies', 'AS Public Health Studies', 'AS Sociology', 'AS Summer and Intersession Programs']",Krieger School of Arts and Sciences,3.00,

Summer 2020,,['Online'],85,Star Trek Music- The Franchise Frontier,"Music defines the Star Trek experience. Through their continued reuse and repetition, Star Trek’s many musical themes go beyond their original audiovisual frameworks to operate as learned musical-cultural texts. As Star Trek has expanded its content into a myriad of installments and media platforms, this musical symbolism has proved vital in articulating both these differences and “sameness.”

This online, asynchronous course uses Star Trek’s music as a tool to investigate musical branding and the creation of meaning in the media we consume every day. Through close viewings—and listenings—of film, television episodes, video games, computer games, commercials, and other media, we will explore the meaning(s) these media construct and acquire as they are re-used and re-purposed in audiovisual contexts. Your work will include studying media clips, television episodes, and some feature-length films; short readings in which we interact with both current and classic scholarly literature; regular discussion posts and responses to our content; a weekly reflection journal of short posts; and a final paper/project on a Star Trek music topic of your choice (1500 words). In so doing, we will hone your analytical skills by learning to critically evaluate filmic media and craft arguments about the roles of music/sound in film.","['AS Music', 'AS Summer and Intersession Programs']",Krieger School of Arts and Sciences,3.00,

The history of fakes, lies, and forgeries transcends human history and encompasses nearly every discipline within the liberal Arts, from literature, art, and philosophy, to history, religion, and archaeology. Human civilization has been filling gaps in the historical record and inventing alternative narratives for all sorts of reasons: political, commercial, evangelical, and personal. This course examines this dark undercurrent within human achievement across historical time, exploring specific examples of historical and literary forgeries that date from the biblical Flood to the future Apocalypse. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p>We will exploring the textual traditions of false archaeological discoveries and fabricated epigraphic fragments from classical antiquity, manufactured time capsules bearing pagan prophecies of the coming of Jesus, fake “illuminations” of Christopher Columbus and Joan of Arc, preposterous accounts of the world’s great “travel liars,” and even look at books from Shakespeare’s own library bearing his personal “annotations.” In the process, we will learn that history’s fakes and forgeries are also, in part, creative and imaginative enterprises that require considerable knowledge, creativity, and even inspiration, to pull them off effectively. At every stage this on-line course will draw upon the riches of JHU’s own Bibliotheca Fictiva, the world’s premier rare book and manuscript research collection dedicated to literary forgeries across the millennia. <o:p></o:p></span></p>",['AAP Liberal Arts'],Krieger School of Arts and Sciences Advanced Academic Programs,3.00,

Who or what is it for? What is its desired or intended impact on the audience? What are the germs of creativity, or what is the critical environment for its emergence? Is creativity and artistic inspiration an individual privilege, or can it be shared broadly in society, or in a community? What is the political role or place of the artist and his/her work? Philosophers read in this class may include Plato, of course, but also Aristotle, Augustin, Aquinas, Hume, Burke, Kant, Hegel, Schopenhauer and Nietzsche, among others.

This means that in addition to questions of justice and right we will examine how the thinkers of the Founding era understood the human being, and the sort of governmental structures that are built on this understanding. We will also consider the revolution in American politics that occurs in the 20th century. The progressive movement of the 20th century builds on a different view of human nature and metaphysics (originating in, but ultimately transcending, Hegelian Idealism), and therefore finds itself in tension with the principles of the Founding. This tension is one of the animating forces of American political partisanship today, so an understanding of the development of American political theory will help us to better understand political disagreements in our own day.

Deep Ecology asks deep questions and aims to bring about long-range goals in moving away from anthropocentrism to ecocentrism, calling for a major paradigm shift in perception, values, and lifestyles. Planetary and human survival is at stake due to climate change — this is humanity’s global ultimate concern. Scientists, environmental activists, and representatives of humanities agree that we need a new paradigm shift, that it is unsustainable to treat the living earth organism as an infinite resource of “energy.” Western environmental practices have been based on anthropocentric view of nature where humans occupy the top of the hierarchy in the chain of life. There is an urgent need for a new environmental ethic that will fundamentally reorient humans in their thinking and relating to the natural environment.

Summer 2020,,['Online'],81,Museums and Community Engagement,"This course explores how museums and cultural organizations of all sizes can strengthen their relationships with the communities they serve. No longer are museums measured and judged solely by their internal resources—collections, endowments, facilities, and staff—but rather by the external benefits and value they create for individuals and communities. Growing numbers of museums are learning to make their organizations more meaningful and relevant by involving their communities in ongoing planning and decision-making. They are reframing museum activities to focus on what matters to their communities. By getting involved in community challenges and developing new partnerships, they are identifying underserved audiences and creating memorable visitor experiences. As museums begin this journey towards community engagement, they are initiating and facilitating social change and moving towards social entrepreneurship. This course includes the theory and skills of community engagement, drawing on both research and practice for examples.",['AAP Museum Studies'],Krieger School of Arts and Sciences Advanced Academic Programs,3.00,
Summer 2020,,['Online'],81,"Museums, Race, and Inclusion","For over two decades, museums have been grappling with how to increase participation and engagement with community members who are historically under-engaged. By and large, the 2012 Center for the Future of Museum’s Report informs us that of the core group of museum visitors, less than 10% represent visitors of color. This course will examine the historical arch of diversity and inclusion initiatives in the field including recent activism as engineered by museum activists and change-makers of the Inclusive Museum Movement. We will explore and define discourses of participation within museum scholarship. This course will use interdisciplinary pedagogies such as Critical Race Theory and Social Inclusion Theory as informative frameworks to help us interrogate our current museum praxis, the museum space, and how invisible social structures such as institutional racism, privilege, and oppression impact our understanding of terms such as diversity, inclusion, equity, and access. In this course, we will explore why race matters in museums and seek to create and identify new discourses on diversity and inclusion for a more vibrant, 21st century museum social ecosystem.",['AAP Museum Studies'],Krieger School of Arts and Sciences Advanced Academic Programs,3.00,

Summer 2020,,['Online'],81,NAGPRA: Repatriation as Compliance or Ethical Practice,"In the United States, the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA) outlines a process by which government agencies (and those who receive government funding) must return human remains and sacred objects to those who claim them. Repatriation is a complicated process because it means something different in almost every case. One of its earliest claims took 20-years to resolve. In 2017, the Ancient One was returned to the tribes of the Columbia River for reburial after DNA tests proved the relationship that tribes had claimed all along. But now reproductions of the Ancient One’s skull are being sold by a company that holds the copyright. When those from outside the culture to which he was returned can examine and/or profit from a replica, the distinction between compliance with the law and the ethics of return is clear. Outside of the United States, few repatriation laws exist and many argue that institutions like The British Museum are the best places to protect world heritage. Is providing care of and access to human remains and cultural objects preferable over returning heritage to those from which it was taken? In this course, we examine repatriation claims around the globe in order to critique NAGPRA and establish a compliance toolkit. Where NAGPRA doesn’t apply, heritage professionals can use the successes and failures of past repatriations, and a firm grounding in ethics, to make repatriation decisions. Nothing in NAGPRA prohibits practitioners from exceeding its scope and seeking out opportunities to build relationships with descendent communities even when repatriation is not required by law.",['AAP Cultural Heritage Management'],Krieger School of Arts and Sciences Advanced Academic Programs,3.00,

Summer 2020,,['Online'],81,Separation of Powers and Democratic Governance,"The separation of powers is America’s most profound and useful political contribution to the world. Studying its principles, development, and decay is a requirement for understanding American politics and is as well a potential benefit to students of aspiring democracies throughout the world. For the separation of powers enables self-government, putting democratic principles of equality and liberty into practice while moderating the powers of majorities.

We will study the principles and practice of the separation of powers by examining how each elected branch of government protects its rights, while checking the rights of others. The separation of powers can be said to have produced a more just and moderate democratic form of government, but it has also occasioned the complaint that it has produced gridlock and incompetence. To investigate the strengths and drawbacks of the separation of powers, we will pay close attention to the classic texts advocating the separation of powers, such as The Federalist Papers; the great changes in American politics effected by the Civil War, the Progressive movement, and the New Deal; and the domestic and foreign policy debates in recent administrations. Special attention will be paid to the seminal opinions of the unelected branch of American government, the Supreme Court. 

The course will note in particular the contemporary challenges to the separation of powers, evidenced in the rise of the administrative state, the expanding powers of courts, and the growth of party government.

Summer 2020,,['Online'],81,Environmental Justice and Ethics Incorporated into Environmental Decision-Making,"This course focuses on the practical decision-making challenges facing environmental engineers, planners, and managers when implementing programs and projects from creation to completion. It begins by exploring the foundations of the energy and climate justice movements in terms of current and emerging issues, Accessibility and indigenous rights are examined for practical factors impacting effective implementation of projects.  Students are required to focus on the praxis of solutions for effective decision-making approaches for including diverse stakeholders as part of their management approach.  This course examines claims made by diverse groups along with the regulatory and government policy responses that address perceived inequity and injustice. The course will study the mechanisms that give rise to class, racial, ableism and other kinds of disparities that impact environmental decision-making which can be barriers to achieving the sustainability development goals that broadly involve these stakeholders. This includes the study of affected constituents, communities, industry, government, activists, policy makers, and scholars, allowing students to learn about the causes and consequences of inequitable distributions of benefits and hazards. Students will learn about various methods for researching climate and energy justice issues and strategies for formulating policies and collaborating with communities. In this course, students will review theories and perspectives through case studies of Black Americans, Latinas, Asians, disability, and indigenous communities. The class will focus mainly on the United States but will include aspects of international issues and perspectives through assignments. There will be flexible options for students to participate in game simulations on climate justice and sustainability issues and when possible, include international participants and guest speakers from these diverse communities.","['PE Climate, Energy, and Environmental Sustainability', 'PE Environmental Planning and Management']",Whiting School of Engineering for Professionals,3.00,

Summer 2020,,['Online'],81,WWW Security,"This course examines issues associated with making web applications secure. The principal focus is on server-side security such as CGIsecurity, proper server configuration, and firewalls. The course also investigates the protection of connections between a client and server using current encryption protocols (e.g., SSL/TLS) as well discussing the related attacks on these protocols (e.g., Heartbleed, CRIME, etc.). The course also investigates keeping certain data private from the server system (e.g., via third-party transaction protocols like SET, or PCI DSS standard). Elementary Number Theory will be reviewed. Finally, the course explores client-side vulnerabilities associated with browsing the web, such as system penetration, information breach, identity theft, and denial-of-service attacks. Related topics such as malicious e-mails, web bugs, spyware,and software security are also discussed. Labs and various serverside demonstrations enable students to probe more deeply into security issues and to develop and test potential solutions. Basic knowledge of operating systems is recommended. Students will download and install a Virtual Machine to be used in the course.

Summer 2020,,['Homewood Campus'],17,Medicine & The Body: Exploring Narrative Mysteries,"Exploring Narrative Mysteries examines the profound and unexpected ways that the humanities intersect with medicine, science, and technology. It is a street with two-way traffic. Disease is a central concern in the human condition, recorded vividly in fiction, opera, and poetry, and studied in a variety of social sciences. Yet stories reside at the center of the medical experience, doctors and researchers often require the tools of consolation and inspiration possessed by the most compelling storytellers to be effective in their profession.

Students will be guided in this exploration by Lakshmi Krishnan, a researcher who has blazed paths of excellence in both medicine and the humanities. Krishnan is an alumna of Johns Hopkins School of Medicine (M.D., 2014), and a recipient of a Rhodes Scholarship, who took her Ph.D. in English Literature at the University of Oxford.


The course draws upon the resources offered by the world-renowned Johns Hopkins medical school, as well as the deep traditions of excellence in the university’s departments in the arts and sciences.

It is an opportunity for students to discover that the quality of the stories told by patients and doctors exerts a profound effect on our own health and the science of medicine itself. And they will emerge from the course – and many others offered by Johns Hopkins Summer Programs – energized by the possibilities of profound discovery across disciplines.",['AS Summer and Intersession Programs'],Krieger School of Arts and Sciences,0.00,

Summer 2020,,['Washington DC Center'],01,"Politics and Risk: Countries, Policies and Institutions","Politics affects risk on many levels (e.g., international, national, regional, and local), and is the result of the interaction of many different elements. In this course, we start by examining some basic issues with regard to risk analysis as well as why forecasts often fall short before examining three broad issues: country structural fragility; problems with collective action policymaking; and operational breakdowns. The first looks at how the sociopolitical and institutional dynamics of a country affects its evolution. The second looks at how the policy formulation process works and why it often yields a less than ideal result. The third looks at the challenges of implementation. As such, the class focuses more on the risks that face countries than on how particular risks might impact corporations or NGOs, though the latter is also examined. The two types of risks are related but are not identical (e.g., regulatory changes may be good for a country, but bad for a company or NGO). We conclude by examining how to prioritize and mitigate risk. Each class aims to provide students with a set of frameworks to think about and assess these issues. Students all get a chance to work on case studies to develop their skills.

Throughout the course, we critically evaluate different political science theories of foreign economic policymaking in emerging markets.  The course begins with an overview of theories of international political economy.   The second section of the course focuses on developing countries’ embrace of economic globalization over the past thirty years.  We examine different political reasons for why emerging market and developing countries have liberalized foreign trade, removed barriers to foreign investment, and reduced the state’s role in the domestic economy since the 1980s.  The final section of the course of the course explores how globalization has impacted emerging market economies, and considers how governments in these countries have dealt with the new challenges that have emerged in this era of economic globalization.

Depending on individual motivation, commitment, experience and language background, the course should allow students to reach between the A1 (Breakthrough) A2 (Way stage) levels of the Common European Framework of Reference. The CEFR describes what a learner is supposed to be able to do in reading, listening, speaking and writing at each level, specifically:

A1. Can understand and use familiar everyday expressions and very basic phrases aimed at the satisfaction of needs of a concrete type. Can introduce him/herself and others and can ask and answer questions about personal details such as where he/she lives, people he/she knows and things he/she has. Can interact in a simple way provided the other person talks slowly and clearly and is prepared to help.

A2. Can understand sentences and frequently used expressions related to areas of most immediate relevance (e.g. very basic personal and family information, shopping, local geography, employment). Can communicate in simple and routine tasks requiring a simple and direct exchange of information on familiar and routine matters. Can describe in simple terms aspects of his/her background, immediate environment and matters in areas of immediate need.

The approach is communicative: priority will be given to the ability to express oneself meaningfully and to make oneself understood.

Language is always presented in context; grammar, phonology, lexis and all other features of actual language use in every-day situations are analyzed.

 The course intends to develop the four skills of listening, speaking, reading and writing, however the main focus will be on speaking and listening in order to give the students the opportunity to interact with native speakers as soon as possible and take advantage of living in Italy.","['SA Italian', 'SB Language']",Nitze School of Advanced International Studies,0.00,
