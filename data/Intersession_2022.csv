Intersession 2022,,['Online'],33,B'More: Integrative Medicine,"Worldwide, the burden of our health costs are due to preventable chronic diseases such as diabetes, obesity, cancer, cardiovascular disease, neurological and substance abuse issues. Because lifestyle, diet, lack of exercise and stress are major contributing factors, Traditional Medicine (TM) or Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) approaches are becoming increasingly important globally. Distinguishing between Traditional and Modern medicines, we will consider the rising use of Integrative Medicine as the upcoming model for the Healing Arts. Students will be introduced to some of the most popular types of TM or CAM, including biologically based practices. Strategies for optimal health during your academic years will be offered and demonstrated.

A tasty survey of this process’s stages, and the parallel virtual visit to the most celebrated and most extraordinary libraries that history has encountered, will lead the students into a world much more vivacious and sparkling than one would imagine, a world – we may say – of human magic. A world that has probably something to tell us still nowadays.","['AS Classics', 'AS History', 'AS Modern Languages and Literatures']",Krieger School of Arts and Sciences,2.00,
Intersession 2022,,['Online'],12,Orpheus: A Retrospective,"Musician, prophet, vagabond, queer icon--for millennia, Orpheus has blurred lines between fact and fiction, gay and straight, even life and death. This class looks back at Orpheus, who looked back at Eurydice, asking why this tragic figure holds such gravitas for so many. We will study poems by Virgil, Ovid, Poliziano, Rilke (in translation), and Atwood, as well as Jean Cocteau's Orphée (1950), Arcade Fire's Reflektor (2013), and the colossus in  Baltimore.","['AS Classics', 'AS English']",Krieger School of Arts and Sciences,1.00,

The second half of the course will focus on The Silmarillion with particular attention to how it anticipates The Lord of the Rings and foregrounds the development of the high fantasy subgenre in popular literature.","['AS English', 'AS Summer and Intersession Programs']",Krieger School of Arts and Sciences,1.00,
Intersession 2022,,['Online'],22,Feminism and Science Fiction: Mary Shelley and Octavia Butler,"This discussion-based course addresses an enduring topic of feminist reflection and polemic: reproduction. We will read Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein and Octavia Butler’s “Bloodchild” along with key texts from several strands of feminist theory (including Black feminism, Marxist feminism, feminist science studies, the Wages for Housework movement, and Social Reproduction Theory). Written centuries apart, Shelley and Butler’s works converge on the question of reproduction, asking: what happens when it is not a woman who “gives birth,” and what if the being they give birth to is not human? How do the economic, social, cultural, and political systems in which we live revolve around reproduction? How is reproduction implicated in our individual and collective futures, and our ability to imagine and to respect difference? With these texts as our laboratories, we will explore the multiple registers of meaning and structures of power across which reproduction slices (e.g., sex/gender, biology, culture and economics, epistemology) and the network of concerns with which it is enmeshed (e.g. motherhood, care, the home, femininity, the family, labor, class, sexuality, the erotic, monstrosity, embodiment, race). We will approach Shelley and Butler’s texts not as blank screens on which to apply interpretive frameworks, but as fictions that think with and against the theorists we will read alongside them.","['AS English', 'AS Summer and Intersession Programs']",Krieger School of Arts and Sciences,1.00,

Intersession 2022,,['Online'],31,Digital Art on the Blockchain,"NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, have exploded into popular culture in the last year as a way to buy and sell digital assets using cryptocurrency. The digital artist Beeple, in likely the highest-profile example to date, sold a mosaic of images from his long-running Everydays series for $69 million, while NBA Top Shot has released thousands of collectible basketball highlights generating over half a billion dollars. Met at once with skepticism as an overhyped bubble waiting to burst and acclaim as a revolutionary shift in finance and the art market, NFTs raise a number of questions about the future of digital objects and networks—and about the cultures that daily interact with these objects and networks. This course introduces students to the phenomenon of NFTs with a two-pronged approach of discussing cryptocurrency as a cultural technology and minting their own digital artworks on the blockchain. We will cover how various distributed ledgers operate, how digital coins circulate, and what the difference is between digital coins and NFTs. We will have conversations with digital artists in the NFT market and discuss how these new assets disrupt traditional hierarchies and open possibilities for underrepresented creators to take control of their work. Students will also have the opportunity to mint their own NFTs, with workshops to help even nonartists generate an artwork and all digital coins fully provided with course registration. The course is co-taught by Jimmy Joe Roche, a multimedia artist with work in NFTs, and Kyle Stine, a cultural historian with research in new media and internet art.","['AS Film and Media Studies', 'AS Summer and Intersession Programs']",Krieger School of Arts and Sciences,1.00,

Demystifying the Entertainment Business is a two-week online course that offers students insight into: behind-the-camera careers in the field (specifically writing, directing, producing, and developing); how to best prepare for those careers; and how to break into the industry once graduation finally comes. 
Students should be prepared to write and read scripts, offer feedback to their fellow students, shoot and edit videos, and create career goal maps and resumes. (Note: some level of basic shooting and video editing acumen will be necessary, as a short film deliverable will be required for successful course completion.) By the end of the course students will understated the basic mechanics of the entertainment industry and where they might like to fall within it, and they will walk away with a complete short film they've written and directed.","['AS Film and Media Studies', 'AS Summer and Intersession Programs']",Krieger School of Arts and Sciences,1.00,

Most Americans agree that police departments need reform but disagree on how.  Some support abolishing the police yet differ on what might replace them; others offer a set of procedural interventions to mitigate the implicit biases of police officers.  Still, others double-down on “law and order” policing and propose hiring more officers equipped with an ever more powerful arsenal.  What role, if any, should police play in society?  How should governments police the police?  Who gets to decide?  In this course, students will examine theories of policing, causes of police violence and its democratic consequences, and proposals for reform and abolition.  In addition to class instruction, students will observe Baltimore’s criminal legal system in-person or virtually by observing their choice of a criminal court preliminary hearings, a BPD Civilian Review Board meeting, or a BPD officer’s disciplinary administrative hearing.","['AS Political Science', 'AS Summer and Intersession Programs']",Krieger School of Arts and Sciences,1.00,

When and how did students fight policies of their campuses and governments? On what grounds do students find solidarity with other groups? How do we define “success” of a campaign or movement? How is student activism different or similar to other activism? This course will survey oral histories, primary documents, and secondary assessments about student activism.

Ice in its contained form, however, provides the ground for pleasurable entertainment and every year in December outdoor ice rinks open in central plazas all over the world. As Kierkegaard’s ‘Jewel on Thin Ice Parable’ illustrates, ice skating captures the tension between art, nature, and society in the modern age, not least symbolized through the ice skate with its machine-made steel blade. On the basis of Burke’s and Kant’s ideas of the sublime and beautiful, this class aims to give an overview on the poetics of skating as an aesthetic experience of transcendence and a metaphor for poetic composition by studying an excerpt of Wordsworth’s “The Prelude”, poems by Lee-Hamilton, Kirsch, Goethe and Klopstock (the latter both passionate ice skaters). We will also analyze how skating scenes can illustrate the idea of “breaking the ice” more or less literally in selected scenes from Anna Karenina, Little Women, and Catcher in the Rye. By comparing Disney’s motion picture Frozen and H. C. Andersen’s “The Snow Queen”, we will discuss the aesthetic representation of self-expression and thawed emotions.

Intersession 2022,,['Online'],22,"Public Health, Prose + Purpose: The Role of Story Telling & Self-Car in Public Health Fields","Physician-poet Rafael Campo describes two purposes that poetry serves for him: it acts as a “factory for empathy” to listen and reflect the stories of his patients through creative expression, and it also serves to heal what he describes as “a kind of wound” that comes from being a health professional who experiences the emotional toll alongside his patients. He is one of many health professionals, dating back to 19th century poets such as John Keats, who uses the art of writing as a method of storytelling as well as a personal practice of processing thoughts and emotions. Digital communities of health professionals and creative writers share, publish, and support each other’s work through connection and dialogues, another way that the solitary act of writing transforms into community-building. Furthermore, as the health communications field grows, creative writing can be employed to reach audiences that otherwise go uncaptured by disconnected stories.

In the past 18 months, as public health and healthcare professionals have acutely experienced the tragedy and trauma of the pandemic, the future professionals who step into these fields can be well-served through cultivating a writing practice, whether it is personal or professional. This course will expose students to a variety of interdisciplinary health creative writers, engage in meaningful community exercises around creative writing, and adapt and personalize a mindset for writing about their public health experiences that is authentic to their voice and experience while honoring the work and community who inspired it.",['AS Public Health Studies'],Krieger School of Arts and Sciences,1.00,

From the Clinic to the Cinema,"The idea that the human subject possesses an unconscious mind obeying a logic foreign to consciousness has found a wide application across the sciences and humanities alike. It was first theorized by Sigmund Freud as the basis for psychoanalysis or the “talking cure,” a therapy for the treatment of neurotic suffering. Since then, however, it has become a central concept in film theory and some branches of philosophy, among other disciplines. What is it about the unconscious that makes it such a useful concept for scholars from so many walks of life?

Intersession 2022,,['Washington DC Center'],01,MIEF Applied Research Project,"Being a successful professional involves providing reliable answers to practical questions.  Obtaining reliable answers benefits from two components.  First, one needs a theoretical framework used to organize the data.  Second, one needs a suitable statistical method to summarize the implications and properties of the data so as to develop an intelligible answer to the question at hand.

Unfortunately, there is no “cookbook” available that will turn an amateur into a successful professional.  So this course adopts a case-study approach by focusing on two important questions: How can one measure the degree of international capital mobility and how can one determine the extent to which a particular the exchange rate for a particular currency is misaligned.

In addition to becoming familiar with these two subjects, students develop the habit of asking two important questions for professional life: How do you know and what is the alternative?    A successful applied research project integrates these two questions into providing reliable answers.
