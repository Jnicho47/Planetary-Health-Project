Intersession 2023,,['Homewood Campus'],22,UWP Studio,"Telling Your Story: Telling Your Story is a practical intensive on writing for opportunities such as jobs, internships, and graduate or professional degrees. These workshops will focus specifically on strong application writing skills, such as crafting a memorable narrative, writing about the technical aspects of your work for non-specialist readers, and finessing your tone. Students should come prepared to ""write toward"" real opportunities they are considering and can look forward to receiving personalized feedback on those essays.","['AS Summer and Intersession Programs', 'AS Writing Program']",Krieger School of Arts and Sciences,1.00,
Intersession 2023,,['Homewood Campus'],21,Navigating Your Medical Future Through Self-Authorship,"Innovation in the world of medicine is fueled by individuals who are inspired by their lived experiences and stimulated by their curiosities. Consciously and unconsciously, our lived experiences impact our decision-making, and through reflection and contextual frameworks, we can curate lives that connect to our values and passions. This course aims to create opportunities for students to understand self-authorship as a beneficial process for personal development. They will self-reflect in a way that encourages purpose-focused career exploration in medicine. This process will enhance their personal ability to make internally focused decisions in their professional pursuits. Students will begin to identify how their personal stories, passions, and intellectual curiosities contribute to their distinctiveness in the medical school application process and beyond. Integrated with frameworks from life-design theory, self-authorship, and career development, this course will help discourage the check-box approach to medicine and encourage utilizing personal experiences as a tool in developing a well-rounded medical school application.","['AS Biology', 'AS Summer and Intersession Programs']",Krieger School of Arts and Sciences,1.00,
Intersession 2023,,['Online'],33,B'More: Nutrition and Community,"Eating is more than just grabbing a meal; it’s a fundamental part of our social fabric. At every meal we have the opportunity to build social connections, explore new tastes through culinary adventures, and support the local farming economy by eating local — all while consuming good nutrition for our optimal mental and physical performance. Eating healthy food is both a fundamental need and a fundamental right in our democracy. Students will examine concepts such as food democracy and food justice while learning how organizations in Baltimore work to alleviate the challenges that poor nutrition presents to underserved members of our community. Daily assignments will include  keeping personalized food logs to track calories, micronutrients, fiber, and protein intake using Cronometer software. Required  Materials: 1) Digital Gram Food Scale, and 2) Computer Screen Capture Software.

Intersession 2023,,['Homewood Campus'],33,B'More: Integrative Medicine,"Integrative medicine is an approach that uses the best scientific research and evidence-based practices in Holistic Therapies to enhance the outcomes of modern Western medicine, while alleviating the overwhelm and sky rocketing costs of our current medical system. Because we can implement much holistic medicine ourselves, it knows no economic, social, gender or racial bias. Students will be introduced to various holistic modalities and experience of the self-governing and self-transformation of some of Baltimore’s most underserved populations. This course is open to freshmen only.","['AS Biology', 'AS Summer and Intersession Programs']",Krieger School of Arts and Sciences,1.00,
Intersession 2023,,['Homewood Campus'],22,"Becoming a Change-Maker, Creating a Socially Conscious Career in Science and Health","The world of science and health has the potential for great impact and ability to reshape policies and practices for entire communities.  As we reflect on the personal and professional impact the pandemic has had on us in the fields of science, medicine and health, students will begin to address their power and role in community action. They will identify their own personal social cause, illuminating the relationships, skills, and tactics used for social consciousness, and develop a network of collaborators.  Centered in the methods of Life Design and Emergent Strategy this course will help students develop the mindsets needed to utilize their experience in a dynamic field.","['AS Biology', 'AS Summer and Intersession Programs']",Krieger School of Arts and Sciences,1.00,
Intersession 2023,,['Homewood Campus'],22,Modeling Biological Populations,"Population biologists study the dynamics of how populations behave and change, but these processes are often too complex for direct observation. Computational tools are therefore essential to the study of biological populations as they allow for study across time scales far beyond what can be observed.

Students will be introduced to computational biology, using the fundamentals of coding in the Python programming language. We will apply this code in developing simulations of biological populations, including invasive species and cancerous tumors. Students will enact and observe the effects of various parameters (e.g., mutation, environmental pressure, behavior, random chance) on their populations. We will also explore how these models can be applied in other fields, and how biology makes use of models from fields including linguistics and economics. Upon completing the course, students will be prepared to independently continue learning more advanced programming concepts. Prior programming experience is not required. Students from all departments and at all levels (including freshmen undergraduates) are welcome.","['AS Biology', 'AS Summer and Intersession Programs']",Krieger School of Arts and Sciences,2.00,

Intersession 2023,,['Homewood Campus'],22,Romanticizing Cottagecore: Escapism or Activism?,"This course will examine the rise of the cottagecore aesthetic and movement in conjunction with the pastoral Romantic-era literature from which it heavily draws. From Taylor Swift’s Folklore to sapphic visions of female communes in the woods, cottagecore tracks a collective response to the global pandemic, which found many of us reexamining and reimaging our relationships with work, domesticity, capitalism, and nature. Discussions will draw from Romanticism’s own responses to revolution, industrialization, and urbanization, asking whether the escapism nature and the pastoral seem to offer is a sufficient form of activism—then and now. We will look at the realities of embracing a “cottagecore” lifestyle and aesthetic and tackle questions involving environmentalism, labor, queerness, and feminism.","['AS English', 'AS Summer and Intersession Programs']",Krieger School of Arts and Sciences,1.00,
Intersession 2023,,['Homewood Campus'],12,Adapting Shakespeare,"Shakespeare’s drama is as ubiquitous as English itself, having been adapted, remixed, and reimagined across the globe in the four centuries since its initial productions. In this course, we will consider the ethics, ends, and effects of adapting Shakespeare in the past quarter century, from “low culture” third-wave feminist derivations such as 10 Things I Hate About You to Baz Luhrmann’s infamous 1996 Romeo + Juliet to esteemed plays of the contemporary London theatre. Students with interests in Shakespeare, drama, and/or cinema will find this course especially enriching, though no prior experience with any is requisite.","['AS English', 'AS Summer and Intersession Programs']",Krieger School of Arts and Sciences,1.00,
Intersession 2023,,['Homewood Campus'],22,Chess as Art,"From Shakespeare’s Tempest to the recent popularity of Netflix’s The Queen’s Gambit, art and media have long found inspiration in the game of chess. And discussions of chess often borrow terminology from the arts, with games and moves frequently described as artistic or beautiful. Marcel Duchamp, one of the most innovative visual artists of the 20th century, once said that “while all artists are not chess players, all chess players are artists.” In this Intersession course, we will explore the intersections between art and chess: both the ways artists have found drama and metaphorical significance in the board game, and the ways in which chess itself might meet or confound our aesthetic criteria, as a kind of dramatic performance or living sculpture. And if chess is an art, what does the current era of computer dominance in the game mean— are chess computers artists? No chess playing experience necessary.","['AS English', 'AS Summer and Intersession Programs']",Krieger School of Arts and Sciences,1.00,
Intersession 2023,,['Homewood Campus'],13,Gothic Literature and Empire,"Gothic literature is fascinated with the frightening and the forbidden; a fascination that extends beyond Europe to colonial settings and characters. The genre’s familiar tropes—the distressed heroine, the sexually threatening villain, the haunting ghost, the undying, bloodthirsty vampire, the eerie double—helped give voice to the social, sexual, and racial anxieties nourished by Britain’s growing empire: fears of slave rebellion and anti-colonial revolution, of the moral consequences of the evil of slavery and the brutality of the colonial social order, of miscegenation and degeneration. In this course we will read a handful of literary texts from the 19th and 20th centuries that draw on Gothic preoccupations and conceits to explore the legacies of empire, considering how the genre has served as a vehicle both for fantasies of colonial rule and for critiques of it: a way of both veiling and unveiling the terrifying nature of colonial and postcolonial relations. Primary texts will include Charlotte Smith’s The Story of Henrietta (1800), Charlotte Brontë’s Jane Eyre (1847), and Jamaica Kincaid’s An Autobiography of My Mother (1996).","['AS English', 'AS Summer and Intersession Programs']",Krieger School of Arts and Sciences,2.00,

NFTs have come to be associated most prominently with digital art and collectibles—to say nothing of scam artists and pyramid schemes—but the various token standards captured by the term enable a wide range of functionalities beyond mere ownership of assets, with uses in recordkeeping, credentialing, and cultural areas such as gaming and social networking. To better understand these functions, students will be offered a two-pronged approach of studying cryptocurrency as a cultural technology and minting their own digital artworks on the blockchain. We will cover how various distributed ledgers operate, how digital coins circulate, and what the difference is between digital coins and NFTs. We will have conversations with digital artists in the NFT space and discuss how these new assets disrupt traditional hierarchies and open possibilities for underrepresented creators to take control of their work. Students will also learn the tools to mint their own NFTs, with workshops to help even nonartists generate an artwork and all digital coins fully provided with course registration. The course is co-taught by Jimmy Joe Roche, a multimedia artist with work in NFTs, and Kyle Stine, a film scholar with research in new media and internet art.","['AS Film and Media Studies', 'AS Summer and Intersession Programs']",Krieger School of Arts and Sciences,1.00,

We will explore related questions through the work of the early 20th century novelist and anthropologist Zora Neale Hurston, contemporary scholars of food studies, and by engaging in practices of sharing, preparing, and eating meals. Moving between forms (fiction, ethnography, film, audio, preparing food), students will become familiar with how food may be used to reveal nuanced workings of power, particularly in the production of womanhood and white supremacy, and in practices of survival, resistance, and care.","['AS Anthropology', 'AS Summer and Intersession Programs']",Krieger School of Arts and Sciences,1.00,

How does your brain control these changes? In this course, we will use a much simpler organism, the fruit fly, to investigate those questions. Over the past few decades, scientists have worked hard to figure out how genetics control circadian behavior, how neural circuits in the brain work together to keep track of time, and how the discoveries found in those little flies might be applicable to us humans. In this class, we will discuss real laboratory experiments that have given us critical insight into how our own circadian biology might work.","['AS Neuroscience', 'AS Summer and Intersession Programs']",Krieger School of Arts and Sciences,1.00,

Indeed, film became a forum for imagining digital futures good and bad, utopian and dystopian. More often than not, film about the digital age, and its future, dwelled in ambiguity. In this course, we examine films from the 1980s through the 2010s as historical artifacts in which hopes and fears about the digital future are embedded. We turn to cult classics like “War Games” (1983) and “The Matrix” (1999), satires like “Office Space” (1999), and more recent films like “The Social Network” (2010) and “Her” (2013), to sharpen our engagement with the visions of the digital future — and myths about its past — that circulate in American popular culture. Students should expect to engage with light (~50 pp.) readings assigned for each film, and to write a historically informed film analysis at the conclusion of the course.","['AS History', 'AS Summer and Intersession Programs']",Krieger School of Arts and Sciences,2.00,

Intersession 2023,,['Online'],12,"Public Health, Prose + Purpose: The Role of Story Telling & Care in Public Health Fields","Physician-poet Rafael Campo describes two purposes that poetry serves for him: it acts as a “factory for empathy” to listen and reflect the stories of his patients through creative expression, and it also serves to heal what he describes as “a kind of wound” that comes from being a health professional who experiences the emotional toll alongside his patients. He is one of many health professionals, dating back to 19th century poets such as John Keats, who uses the art of writing as a method of storytelling as well as a personal practice of processing thoughts and emotions. Digital communities of health professionals and creative writers share, publish, and support each other’s work through connection and dialogues, another way that the solitary act of writing transforms into community-building. Furthermore, as the health communications field grows, creative writing can be employed to reach audiences that otherwise go uncaptured by disconnected stories.

In the past 18 months, as public health and healthcare professionals have acutely experienced the tragedy and trauma of the pandemic, the future professionals who step into these fields can be well-served through cultivating a writing practice, whether it is personal or professional. This course will expose students to a variety of interdisciplinary health creative writers, engage in meaningful community exercises around creative writing, and adapt and personalize a mindset for writing about their public health experiences that is authentic to their voice and experience while honoring the work and community who inspired it.","['AS Public Health Studies', 'AS Summer and Intersession Programs']",Krieger School of Arts and Sciences,1.00,

The only pre-requisite is to bring a curious mind with which to look at real-life situations that you may face many times in your lifetime. There is no textbook for the course, but there will be assigned readings and problems. Some of the problems will be assigned working groups with several of your classmates. I urge you to use common sense to solve practical problems. Unfortunately, common sense is becoming increasingly uncommon in our world.","['AS Summer and Intersession Programs', 'EN General Engineering']",Whiting School of Engineering,1.00,

integrated onto a PCB. This course is particularly valuable to engineers who are looking to translate a bulky prototype into a tightly integrated, mass-producible solution. The course will cover all aspects of
PCB development, from schematic layout all the way to surface-mount assembly of components and programming. Students will learn the material by completing a project where each student will design, program, and assemble a PCB watch that they will keep after the course is over. The course is introductory and there are no prerequisites except for familiarity with Arduino and general electronics.","['AS Summer and Intersession Programs', 'EN Electrical & Computer Engineering']",Whiting School of Engineering,1.00,

Thus, the need for technology that can retain the accuracy of traditional machine learning methods while reducing power consumption has become necessary. Neuromorphic engineering, brain-inspired technology using in-memory computing and event-based communication, can help medical technologies by offering desirable device characteristics, such as: low-power, low-latency, & high bandwidth. In this course, we will introduce neuromorphics, which should be accessible to anyone who has taken a non-linear circuits class. We will also demo some neuromorphic hardware and demonstrate its advantages, while also making clear its compatibility with medical technologies.","['AS Summer and Intersession Programs', 'EN Electrical & Computer Engineering']",Whiting School of Engineering,1.00,

Second, one needs a suitable statistical method to summarize the implications and properties of the data so as to develop an intelligible answer to the question at hand.

Unfortunately, there is no “cookbook” available that will turn an amateur into a successful professional.  So this course adopts a case-study approach by focusing on two important questions: How can one measure the degree of international capital mobility and how can one determine the extent to which a particular the exchange rate for a particular currency is misaligned.

In addition to becoming familiar with these two subjects, students develop the habit of asking two important questions for professional life: How do you know and what is the alternative?    A successful applied research project integrates these two questions into providing reliable answers.
