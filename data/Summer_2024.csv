Summer 2024,,['Homewood Campus'],21,Decoding College Writing,"This course examines three broad types of writing students will encounter at and beyond Hopkins: narrative writing, analytical writing, and technical writing. Each has its own implications within the walls of JHU, from research papers to creative projects, but each will extend to the opportunities students pursue outside of academia. Above all, this course demystifies the idea that some writers just “have it” by decoding the processes that lead to great writing and building students’ confidence in written expression to carry forward into their studies and professional pursuits.","['AS Summer and Intersession Programs', 'AS Writing Program']",Krieger School of Arts and Sciences,3.00,
Summer 2024,,['Homewood Campus'],23,Decoding College Writing: Black Midwives & American Gynecology,"In this academic writing course, students will analyze and evaluate sources about enslaved Black midwives, nurses, and Black women whose medical practices and bodies were deemed inferior and flawed yet provided foundational knowledge for white practitioners in the mid-1800s. Over the course, students will practice critical reading and writing through summarizing, analyzing, evaluating, and synthesizing ideas to increase their agency as writers and researchers. This course aims to enable students to write not simply what they know but as a means of inquiry.","['AS Summer and Intersession Programs', 'AS Writing Program']",Krieger School of Arts and Sciences,3.00,

Summer 2024,,['Online'],41,"Population Genomics: Evolution, Extinction & Disease","Population genomics is the study of the structure, function, and variability of the entire genetic complement of organisms considered on a population scale. By examining how gene variants change in structure and frequency in populations over time, we can study the process of evolution and how it contributes to biodiversity and the formation of new species; this information can be used to increase the efficacy of conservation efforts. By studying gene variants underlying diseases at the scale of populations, we can better diagnose complex polygenic diseases like cancer. This course introduces the fundamentals of population genomics and provides an overview of the subfields of evolutionary genomics, conservation genomics, and medical genomics. This course is offered in summer terms only.","['AS Biology', 'AS Summer and Intersession Programs']",Krieger School of Arts and Sciences,1.00,

Summer 2024,,['Online'],82,Developmental Genetics Lab,"CRISPR (clustered regularly-interspaced short palindromic repeat) is one of the greatest advances in biology in the past decade, providing researchers with the tools to precisely and affordably edit genomes and physicians a new tool to cure disease.  However, the ability to edit plant and animal genomes, including human genomes, comes with significant ethical considerations.  This course will utilize a hybrid classroom-laboratory approach to provide students with both a comprehensive knowledge of the CRISPR system and a deeper understanding of how gene function is studied.  At the end of the semester, you will not only understand how CRISPR works, but also have a better understanding of the power of genetics to illuminate molecular mechanisms of protein function.

Summer 2024,,['Online'],83,The Hollywood Novel,"Known as Tinseltown, La-La Land, Lost Angeles, the dream machine that privileges the few and leaves in its wake disillusioned starlets, down-and-out screenwriters, and uncredited extras, Hollywood has seized the imaginations of countless artists, not the least of which being novelists. Over the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, several American writers have produced a small but distinct array of works in the only novelistic subgenre centering an industry: the Hollywood novel. With a grudge against the myth of the West and aesthetic roots in P.T.Barnum’s freak show, this subgenre devotes as much energy to the film industry’s triumphs as it does to the grotesquerie of Hollywood’s failures, exclusions, and false promises. In this course, we will watch a few exemplary films, listen to a radio-play, and read seven short Hollywood novels,
including two epistolary novels, a surrealist satire, a fictive memoir, a psychological novel, a work of science fiction, and a novel in the form of a screenplay. We will pursue the following questions:
What images of the United States emerge when writers foreground the film industry? What stylistic and narrative strategies do these novels derive from filmmaking techniques and technologies? If Hollywood deals mainly in make-belief, what are the realities that the Hollywood novel claims to unveil? Finally, in a culture increasingly occupied by visual media, how do Hollywood novels position their literariness in relation to cinema?","['AS English', 'AS Summer and Intersession Programs']",Krieger School of Arts and Sciences,3.00,

Machine learning models which detect and classify latent features of text, image and sound helped us read ancient scrolls we have not been able to read, improve cancer detection techniques and design better self-driving cars. Machine learning models also became better at producing new text, image and sound. ChatGPT is reaching level of competence which urges us to watermark its output and Dall-E is recreating any image to text in any style requested. The complexity of these models rivals and even surpasses their human counterparts at times. At other times, however, these models also behave shockingly incompetently. Self-driving cars struggle with unfamiliar situations, which give rise from absurd to dangerous situations. The detection models perform significantly worse on groups of individuals lying outside their training data. ChatGPT4 does not sound less confident when it makes up an answer than when it provides accurate information. These failures range from being merely amusing to threatening the very existence of humanity. With its promises of new heights and threats of new lows, machine-learning-based AI raises new and hard ethical issues.

Summer 2024,,['Online'],82,Introduction to Political Theory:  Power and Authority,"This course provides an introduction to Western political theory, focusing on theories and practices of power and authority. We will examine the extent to which it is possible to describe, theorize, and make visible how political power operates, and power's relationship to authority, knowledge, truth, and political freedom. A strong tradition of political thought argues that people's consent is what makes political power legitimate. But what if one of the most insidious workings of power is its ability to prevent us from telling the difference between consent and coercion? Can power allow certain authorities to effectively brainwash people? If so, does that mean that those who obey authority should no longer be held politically responsible for their actions? Does the coercive power of norms and conformity prevent any robust practice of freedom? What role (if any) should state power play in negotiating questions of morality, religion and sexuality? Lastly, we will be haunted by a related question: can political theories of power make people free, or are those theories implicated in the very coercion they profess to oppose? Classes will be a combination of lectures, critical discussions/debates, film screenings and presentations. Throughout the term, you will sharpen your ability to formulate coherent written and spoken arguments by organizing and supporting your thoughts in a persuasive manner. An important part of this skill will include the ability to wrestle with complex and controversial political problems that lack any single answer. The stakes of these problems will be brought to life by the political examples we will study, and made legible by looking through the theoretical lenses of diverse thinkers.","['AS Political Science', 'AS Summer and Intersession Programs']",Krieger School of Arts and Sciences,3.00,

Most simply put, we will be asking what it means to project power without vulnerability. More specifically, we will draw from recent scholarship from a variety of fields to analyze different use cases, geographic theaters, and short- and long-term impacts of their deployment. Issues of asymmetry, surveillance, precision, civilians/enemy combatants, vulnerability, chains of command, and agency will be central to our study.","['AS Political Science', 'AS Summer and Intersession Programs']",Krieger School of Arts and Sciences,3.00,

Summer 2024,,['Online'],83,Spiritual But Not Religious,"What does it mean to be “spiritual but not religious”?  Why do U.S. Millennials and Gen Z continue to leave traditional religious institutions and seek to create alternative structures of meaning?  And why do the majority of Americans who identify as religiously unaffiliated continue to say that they believe in a god? We will explore the history and current landscape of American spirituality and its connections and disconnections from religion and popular psychology. We will also enter the politics of race and cultural appropriation within the “spiritual marketplace,” the corporations and organizations that create products for the religiously unaffiliated (think yoga mats, Rumi calendars, and meditation apps). While asking critical questions about the history, politics and economics of American spirituality, the class takes seriously the existential questions behind spiritual seeking. Throughout the class, students will be invited to explore these questions for themselves through self-reflective and experiential exercises.","['AS Islamic Studies', 'AS Summer and Intersession Programs']",Krieger School of Arts and Sciences,3.00,

Summer 2024,,['Online'],81,Understanding Public Attitudes for the Communication of Climate and Energy Policy,"Public attitudes influence the political feasibility of passing new legislation on climate change policy, and consumer decisions contribute to as much as 40% of national emissions.  As a result, governmental, non-profit, and commercial sectors have become interested in low-cost, non-regulatory “soft policy” approaches based on social science to inform public decision-making and behavior change.  Communication—whether in the form of information provision, participatory decision-making, or social marketing—is among the foremost of these strategies.  This course aims to expose students to social science research and methodology on human attitudes, behaviors, and decision-making with respect to climate and energy policy so they can directly apply it in their professional organizations.  This course will challenge students not only to think about the varied communication factors that influence human decision-making and behavior, but to use that information in designing and evaluating programs.  Special attention is given to the application of behavioral economics to climate, energy, and other environmental issues, and students will learn the fundamentals of social science statistical analysis using SPSS software.

In other words, we are going to examine the political philosophy that serves as a basis for the American regime (or regimes, if one is so inclined). This means that in addition to questions of justice and right we will examine how the thinkers of the Founding era understood the human being, and the sort of governmental structures that are built on this understanding. We will also consider the revolution in American politics that occurs in the 20th century. The progressive movement of the 20th century builds on a different view of human nature and metaphysics (originating in, but ultimately transcending, Hegelian Idealism), and therefore finds itself in tension with the principles of the Founding. This tension is one of the animating forces of American political partisanship today, so an understanding of the development of American political theory will help us to better understand political disagreements in our own day.

The Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA) is considered a U.S. human rights law developed by Native advocates and museums. The law provides for graves protection on federal and Tribal lands; repatriation to lineal descendants and Tribes of Native Ancestors, burial belongings, sacred objects, and objects of cultural patrimony; and criminal penalties for illegal trafficking of NAGPRA cultural items. In addition to NAGPRA, other federal, state, and Native Nation laws may apply to the taking of Native Ancestors and cultural heritage within the boundaries of the United States. Outside of the United States, few repatriation laws exist, and there remain problematic processes for returning Native bodies and cultural heritage from other countries’ institutions and private collections.

In this course, we examine the NAGPRA law and its regulations to critique NAGPRA and understand best practices and tools for compliance. Where NAGPRA does not apply – such as with international repatriation, the accession of new Indigenous collections, and the sale of Indigenous culture by private collectors – museum and heritage professionals will learn how other applicable laws, as well as the development of ethical policies in your institution, can support human rights and reinvigorate cultures.","['AAP Cultural Heritage Management', 'AAP Museum Studies']",Krieger School of Arts and Sciences Advanced Academic Programs,3.00,

With the Great Recession of 2007–2012, the United States experienced the biggest economic crisis and ensuing downturn since the crash of 1929 and Great Depression of the 1930s.

This forgetfulness comes at great expense to society. This course provides a tour of the country’s major boom-and-bust-cycles, with a focus on last century, and particularly the last three decades, when such events became more numerous. After each debacle, laws and rules changed.

Students are tasked to produce a market feasibility report (along with a financial proforma) that will help the city’s stakeholders decide whether to pursue the project or not. Students will also dissect and analyze the city’s negotiated development review and permitting process to understand what it takes to earn community and political support.

Learning outcomes:
• Demonstrate an understanding of the zoning, other regulatory processes, and requirements applicable to the site – i.e., the entitlements process
• Demonstrate an understanding of the interplay between the financial constraints and financing mechanisms that would be applicable to any critical infrastructure project
• Demonstrate an understanding of the design and construction processes and their impact on development and financing decisions
• Describe the role that social justice goals play in critical community infrastructure investment analysis",['BU Real Estate'],Carey Business School,2.00,

Summer 2024,,['Online'],81,Introduction to Financial Derivatives,"This is the first of a two-course sequence devoted to the mathematical modeling of securities and the markets in which they are created and exchanged. The basic cash, hybrid, and derivative instruments are reviewed and set in a rigorous mathematical context. This includes equities, bonds, options, forwards, futures, and swaps, as well as their dealer, overthe-counter, and exchange environment. Models of the term structure of interest rates, spot rates and, the forward rate curve are treated; derived from cash instruments (e.g., bonds and interest rates like LIBOR) as well as from derivatives (such as Eurodollar futures and swaps). Principles of static, discrete, continuous and dynamic probabilistic models for derivative analysis (including the Weiner process, Ito’s Lemma, and an introduction to risk-neutral valuation) are applied to develop the 
binomial tree approach to option valuation, the Black-ScholesMerton differential equation, and the Black-Scholes formulas for option pricing.

Work in the course will consist of weekly assignments on one or more of the readings and a final paper on a topic chosen by the student and approved by the instructor.","['AS Summer and Intersession Programs', 'EN Computer Science']",Whiting School of Engineering,1.00,
Summer 2024,,['Online'],88,Intermediate Programming,"This course teaches intermediate to advanced programming, using C and C++. (Prior knowledge of these languages is not expected.) We will cover low-level programming techniques, as well as object-oriented class design, and the use of class libraries. Specific topics include pointers, dynamic memory allocation, polymorphism, overloading, inheritance, templates, collections, exceptions, and others as time permits. Students are expected to learn syntax and some language specific features independently. Course work involves significant programming projects in both languages.","['AS Summer and Intersession Programs', 'EN Computer Science']",Whiting School of Engineering,4.00,
Summer 2024,,['Online'],88,Computer System Fundamentals,"We study the design and performance of a variety of computer systems from simple 8-bit micro-controllers through 32/64-bit RISC architectures all the way to ubiquitous x86 CISC architecture. We'll start from logic gates and digital circuits before delving into arithmetic and logic units, registers, caches, memory, stacks and procedure calls, pipelined execution, super-scalar architectures, memory management units, etc. Along the way we'll study several typical instruction set architectures and review concepts such as interrupts, hardware and software exceptions, serial and other peripheral communications protocols, etc. A number of programming projects, frequently done in assembly language and using various processor simulators, round out the course.

Summer 2024,,['Homewood Campus'],11,Mathematical Foundations for Computer Science,"This course provides an introduction to mathematical reasoning and discrete structures relevant to computer science. Topics include propositional and predicate logic, proof techniques including mathematical induction, sets, relations, functions, recurrences, counting techniques, simple computational models, asymptotic analysis, discrete probability, graphs, trees, and number theory.","['AS Summer and Intersession Programs', 'EN Computer Science']",Whiting School of Engineering,4.00,
Summer 2024,,['Online'],88,Full-Stack JavaScript,"A full-stack JavaScript developer is a person who can build modern software applications using primarily the JavaScript programming language. Creating a modern software application involves integrating many technologies - from creating the user interface to saving information in a database and everything else in between and beyond. A full-stack developer is not an expert in everything. Rather, they are someone who is familiar with various (software application) frameworks and the ability to take a concept and turn it into a finished product. This course will teach you programming in JavaScript and introduce you to several JavaScript frameworks that would enable you to build modern web, cross-platform desktop, and native/hybrid mobile applications. A student who successfully completes this course will be on the expedited path to becoming a full-stack JavaScript developer.","['AS Summer and Intersession Programs', 'EN Computer Science']",Whiting School of Engineering,3.00,

The overarching theme is detection and reduction of potential legal/cybersecurity risks. We start by exploring the legal and regulatory environment that influences and supports cyber-based activities and programs, focusing on multidisciplinary or integrated views of enterprise risk management. We will address key risk management issues from the legal and cybersecurity aspects and analyze legal/ cybersecurity issues in several of the critical infrastructure sectors, such as the financial services, healthcare and public health, and transportation systems sectors. We also review legal and regulatory compliance issues to address cybersecurity risk management for systems development, acquisition, and operation. This includes material impacting the manner in which the cyber community operates, for example, FITARA (Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act) Enhancement Act of 2017. We then review the authoritative guidance provided by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework. The Framework is voluntary for the sixteen critical information sectors and mandatory for the federal government, hence the focus on NIST. Risk management threat detection and avoidance is analyzed from an integrated legal/cybersecurity perspective, including system objectives to avert legal liability and minimize enterprise and human loss. Examples address financial services, healthcare and public health, and transportation (mobile devices and autonomous vehicles) systems, and cyber-physical systems (CPS) or Internet of Things (IoT).

Summer 2024,,['Online'],81,The Bold Science Motivating and Enabled by our Engineering,"This course will introduce students to the connection between innovative space engineering and the most significant scientific breakthroughs that have resulted from it.  This course will first explore the early generation of engineering tools that were turned to the night sky due to curiosity, and the discoveries that were made.  These tools fundamentally changed our understanding of what our place in the Universe was, and the exploration led to a new framework for how engineers and scientists partner together to advance space exploration.   A long line of observatories, both on the ground and in space, followed and have brought the wonders of the cosmos to humanity.  The latest marvel of engineering in this line of engineering tools, a tennis-court sized “eye” in space called the Webb Telescope, was just launched and has revealed the Universe to us in unimaginable ways.  It took 20,000 engineers and scientists working over 20 years to enable this mission. The course will explore how these engineering marvels were motivated and built, how they are used, the challenges that were encountered along the way, and how we plan to move forward to chase down even bolder pursuits (e.g., a new generation of robotic engineering experiments to detect life on alien moons in the Solar System).
This course is also being given during an era in which space exploration is one of the most exciting, fast-paced, and rapidly growing industries.  The increased competition from hundreds of private companies that are entering space is resulting in incredible reductions in the cost to access to space, and has led to an explosion in the number of launches and space-based assets.  Lessons in the course will challenge students to explore the modern capabilities of the space industry and how these innovations will power future scientific pursuits.",['PE Space Systems Engineering'],Whiting School of Engineering for Professionals,3.00,

Summer 2024,,['Washington DC'],01,Financial Crises and Policy Dilemmas in Emerging Markets,"The course will focus on key macroeconomic and financial policy issues with a focus on Emerging Markets. The course is divided into two parts. The first part explores the causes, dynamics and consequences of selected crises episodes affecting emerging markets, from the debt crises of the 1980’s to the COVID-19 pandemic. The second part of the course addresses selected issues regarding crisis resolution, including the political economy of crises, their long run impacts on the economy, and the future of the international financial architecture. By the end of the course, it is expected that students will be able to identify the major factors leading to crises in emerging markets, assess the difficult policy trade-offs that policymakers face when dealing with crises, and evaluate alternative policy options.","['SA Development, Climate, and Sustainability', 'SA International Economics and Finance']",Nitze School of Advanced International Studies,4.00,
Summer 2024,,['Washington DC'],01,Business and Human Rights in the Global Economy,"This course is centered around three main questions: whether business should be concerned about its human rights impacts, the increasing importance of corporate human rights due diligence, and what type of remedy is available for victims of corporate abuse. Students will gain expertise on human rights related business risks and how to advise companies in a transnational business environment through role-playing exercises and case studies like the FIFA 2022 World Cup in Qatar and Apple in China. The course will focus on corporate sustainability, in light of pressures facing business at home and abroad, including their response to issues such as climate change, the COVID pandemic, and systemic racism.

The class will address the crucial role of investors, civil society and consumers, and the legal regime in rewarding (and penalizing) businesses that do not take human rights and the environment into account. By the end of the course, students will have gained advocacy writing experience from the point of view of a civil society activist, as well as a corporate change maker, and the opportunity to engage first hand with guest lecturers working on these issues.

Summer 2024,,['Online'],91,Political Risk: Analyzing and Managing Challenges in a World of Growing Disorder,"Politics affects risk on many levels (e.g., international, national, regional, and local), and is the result of the interaction of many different elements. In this course, we start by examining some basic issues with regard to risk analysis as well as why forecasts often fall short before examining three broad issues: country structural fragility; problems with collective action policymaking; and operational breakdowns. The first looks at how the sociopolitical and institutional dynamics of a country affects its evolution. The second looks at how the policy formulation process works and why it often yields a less than ideal result. The third looks at the challenges of implementation. As such, the class focuses more on the risks that face countries than on how particular risks might impact corporations or NGOs, though the latter is also examined. The two types of risks are related but are not identical (e.g., regulatory changes may be good for a country, but bad for a company or NGO). We conclude by examining how to prioritize and mitigate risk. Each class aims to provide students with a set of frameworks to think about and assess these issues. Students all get a chance to work on case studies to develop their skills.

This intensive, four-week preterm course is designed to provide graduate students with an opportunity to hone their academic writing and reading skills in preparation for their first semester at SAIS. Students will develop these skills via a range of synchronous and asynchronous activities that closely mirror the tasks they’ll undertake in their Fall courses. During the live group seminars and workshops held regularly each week, the instructor will i) develop students’ understanding of specific essay typologies; ii) help students improve their hold over grammatical and syntactical accuracy via textual editing tasks, and iii) lead students in a discussion of the required readings. The individual writing consultations, held each week, will provide students with the opportunity to review their language challenges directly with the writing instructor.

Summer 2024,,['SAIS Europe'],20,"Italian, Intensive","Intensive Italian is a one hundred-hour in-person course for beginners. In addition to providing a linguistic and cultural foundation for daily life and linguistic autonomy in Bologna, the Intensive Italian course is the perfect tool for those who wish to continue studying Italian. This course offers a solid communicative, functional, lexical, and grammatical foundation, from which students can further enrich their linguistic competence in Italian.

Methodology and Teaching Techniques
The focus of Intensive Italian is twofold: communication and formal correctness with an awareness of linguistic accuracy. Being a course taught with a notional-functional method, Intensive Italian enables students to ""do things with the language"" while also understanding the linguistic mechanisms underlying individual communicative acts. Peer work, project-based learning, and accurate linguistic and metalinguistic reflections are the strengths of the Intensive course. Learning takes place through informal and autonomous activities, but with continuous support from the instructor and moments of formal reflection on the language mechanisms.
Depending on individual motivation, commitment, experience, and language background, the course should enable students to achieve levels between A1 (Breakthrough) and A2 (Waystage) of the Common European Framework of Reference (CEFR) or Novice High to Intermediate Mid levels of the American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages (ACTFL) Framework.","['SA Italian', 'SB Language']",Nitze School of Advanced International Studies,0.00,
Summer 2024,,['SAIS Europe'],20,"Italian, Survival","Survival Italian is an intensive, fifty-hour, in-person course for beginners. The objective of the course is  to provide an initial linguistic and cultural foundation in Italian to begin building one's autonomy in Bologna, and for those wishing to continue studying Italian in the Fall, to lay the first foundation in their journey of acquiring the Italian language. For these reasons, the course provides students with elementary vocabulary, key structures, and basic grammatical rules in a steady, progressive, direct, and lively fashion.

Methodology and Teaching Techniques
The focus of Survival Italian is undoubtedly communication: from the first day, the course lessons are conducted in Italian. Efforts are made to avoid, as much as possible, reference to and translation from English, as well as the mechanical study of grammar during the lessons. The method aims to help students think in Italian from the outset and to understand and deduce the rules rather than simply applying them. Metalinguistic analysis does not play a central role in the course. Peer work and project-based learning are two strengths of the Survival course: learning takes place through informal and autonomous activities, but with continuous support from the instructor. Depending on individual motivation, commitment, experience, and language background, the course should allow students to reach between the A1 (Breakthrough) and A2 (Waystage) levels of the Common European Framework of Reference (CEFR) or the Novice High to Intermediate Mid levels of the American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages (ACTFL) Framework.","['SA Italian', 'SB Language']",Nitze School of Advanced International Studies,0.00,
