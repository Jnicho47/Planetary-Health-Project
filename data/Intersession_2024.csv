Intersession 2024,,['Homewood Campus'],21,Navigating Your Medical Future Through Self-Authorship,"Innovation in the world of medicine is fueled by individuals who are inspired by their lived experiences and stimulated by their curiosities. Consciously and unconsciously, our lived experiences impact our decision-making, and through reflection and contextual frameworks, we can curate lives that connect to our values and passions. This course aims to create opportunities for students to understand self-authorship as a beneficial process for personal development. They will self-reflect in a way that encourages purpose-focused career exploration in medicine. This process will enhance their personal ability to make internally focused decisions in their professional pursuits. Students will begin to identify how their personal stories, passions, and intellectual curiosities contribute to their distinctiveness in the medical school application process and beyond. Integrated with frameworks from life-design theory, self-authorship, and career development, this course will help discourage the check-box approach to medicine and encourage utilizing personal experiences as a tool in developing a well-rounded medical school application.","['AS Biology', 'AS Summer and Intersession Programs']",Krieger School of Arts and Sciences,1.00,

Intersession 2024,,['Homewood Campus'],21,"Biopharma 101: How New Drugs are Discovered, Developed, and Approved","This course will focus on the discovery and clinical development of therapeutic drugs and biologics from the perspective of the biopharmaceutical industry. We will discuss the requisite laboratory research that identifies and characterizes molecules that can reach clinical testing in humans, execution of a clinical development plan that includes phase 1, 2, and 3 clinical trials, the generation of clinical evidence that forms the basis for NDA and BLA applications from which pharmaceutical sponsors receive approval from regulatory authorities such as the US FDA.  Ethical conduct in clinical research and the commercial and economic considerations that contribute to decision-making in what drugs for what diseases move forward will be emphasized.","['AS Biology', 'AS Summer and Intersession Programs']",Krieger School of Arts and Sciences,1.00,
Intersession 2024,,['Homewood Campus'],13,Electron Microscopies of the Microcosme,"For the analysis of structural details of specimens ranging from subcellular organelles to viruses and even macromolecular assemblies we need to resort to high energy electron beams as the illuminating source (very short wavelengths) . This is accomplished by using various types of electron microscopes in combination with appropriate “contrasting techniques” to enhance definition of desirable specimen details.

In this course, we will first explain the physics of generating and controlling electron beams, and the principles of electron optics and image acquisition. Next we will examine the most widely used methods of specimen preparation and the steps that preserve critical architectural details despite the desiccating environment inside an electron microscope.

Lectures, twice per week and two hours each, will be followed by “hands on” laboratory practice sessions. The students will learn how to prepare their own specimens and will also be instructed in the use of optimization procedures for image capture and processing. Due to space limitations of an E. M room the laboratory part of this course requires the formation of small-size teams, to be determined after the lecture part is completed and according to student time availability. Class size limit:10

Class is open to all undergraduates; priority will be given to Sophomores with good Physics background. Interested students should contact the instructor PRIOR to attempt registration.","['AS Biology', 'AS Summer and Intersession Programs']",Krieger School of Arts and Sciences,2.00,
Intersession 2024,,['Homewood Campus'],13,Modeling Biological Populations,"Population biologists study the dynamics of how populations behave and change, but these processes are often too complex for direct observation. Computational tools are therefore essential to the study of biological populations as they allow for study across time scales far beyond what can be observed.

Students will be introduced to computational biology, using the fundamentals of coding in the Python programming language. We will apply this code in developing simulations of biological populations, including invasive species and cancerous tumors. Students will enact and observe the effects of various parameters (e.g., mutation, environmental pressure, behavior, random chance) on their populations. We will also explore how these models can be applied in other fields, and how biology makes use of models from fields including linguistics and economics. Upon completing the course, students will be prepared to independently continue learning more advanced programming concepts. Prior programming experience is not required. Students from all departments and at all levels (including freshmen undergraduates) are welcome.","['AS Biology', 'AS Summer and Intersession Programs']",Krieger School of Arts and Sciences,2.00,

Intersession 2024,,['Homewood Campus'],22,What is a Classic? Creativity in an Age of Machines,"Today we suddenly find ourselves in a world where ‘creativity’ is not necessarily a distinctly human endeavor. With the advent of artificial intelligence and the associated promises of a creative machine (be they justified or not), this idea is faced with an unexpected and fundamental challenge. Even those who dismiss AI’s promises as delusional have no choice but to substantiate their view in a new and informed way. 
While our everyday cultures often thrive on remembering, remixing, and reviving their own pasts and, in that, can seem not all that different from what an AI does, people tend to point to the ‘classics’ – as pinnacles of human creativity ¬¬– for explanations.

In this class, we want to contribute to the debate by taking this notion of the ‘classic’ and examine it from various angles: 
•	In the first half of the class, we will look at the nature of a classic: What is the nature of the creativity that produces a classic? Are they really the products of independent bursts of creativity totally different from what AI could do?
•	In the second half, we will explore some social and political implications of the concept of the classic: Who decides what belongs on a list of classics (the so-called canon) in the first place, and are such canons inherently elitist and exclusionary? Who owns classics and the culture around them and what happens when people feel the need to defend their ‘rights’ to them?

We will try to find some tentative answers to these questions by looking at theories from antiquity to today.","['AS Classics', 'AS Summer and Intersession Programs']",Krieger School of Arts and Sciences,1.00,
Intersession 2024,,['Homewood Campus'],22,Animalization and Medicine in the Ancient World and Beyond,"In this course, we will explore the following questions: What does it mean to transform from a human into an animal, permanently and temporarily? What is The Other or non-human being? What does “becoming animal/other” look like and mean in medical contexts? What can we learn about medicine and humanness from animals? 
This course will seek to answer these questions by reading ancient Greco-Roman mythology, examining visual depictions of human-animal transformations/hybrids, and learning about ancient medicine. By the end, students will discuss and critically think about issues in modern medical debates that relate such as Henrietta Lacks and her cells.","['AS Classics', 'AS Summer and Intersession Programs']",Krieger School of Arts and Sciences,1.00,

Starting with Charles Stross’ novel Accelerando (2005), we will examine the Singularity narrative and its reproductions in novels and short films. We will read these texts alongside contemporary theory and criticism to develop an understanding of the myriad cultural dimensions of this seemingly apolitical myth, particularly as it relates to contemporary issues of identity, class, and politics of futurity. Furthermore, for students interested in the contemporary humanities, this course will serve as an introduction to its concerns, questions, and methodologies.","['AS English', 'AS Summer and Intersession Programs']",Krieger School of Arts and Sciences,1.00,
Intersession 2024,,['Homewood Campus'],22,Modern Voyeurs: The Melodramatic Origins of Reality TV,"What can we learn from the nineteenth century about the mass appeal of Reality TV? From polygamy to property makeovers, “real” housewives and hoarders, the guilty pleasure we take in observing the lives of the lower classes and elites is not far off from the nineteenth century’s own melodramatic depictions of a rapidly industrializing world. In the past as well as the present, melodrama serves an important function in sublimating larger social, political, and economic issues into readily digestible, emotively charged narratives. This course seeks to understand the legacy of the melodramatic mode in our current cultural climate, as well as how the particular qualities of this mode allow for the deliberately mindless consumption and surveillance of the social strata that populate our own “reality.”","['AS English', 'AS Summer and Intersession Programs']",Krieger School of Arts and Sciences,1.00,

Demystifying the Entertainment Business is a 4-day intensive course that offers students an insight into: possible behind-the-camera careers in the field (specifically writing, directing, producing, and developing), how to best prepare for those careers, and how to break into the industry once graduation finally comes. Led by JHU alum and TV writer/director/producer, Luke Kelly-Clyne, student assignments will cover a wide range depending on the lesson. Those interested in the course should be prepared to write scripts, read scripts, shoot and edit videos, and create career goal maps and resumes. A virtual screening of all the final film projects will be scheduled for the week following the last class -- attendance is optional but encouraged. (Note: some level of shooting and editing acumen will be necessary for this course, whether it's done by students or their friends, a short film deliverable will be part of the equation for successful course completion.)","['AS Film and Media Studies', 'AS Summer and Intersession Programs']",Krieger School of Arts and Sciences,1.00,

Is intellect and cognition strictly limited to the anatomy of the head? What kind of knowledge informs us about the heads we carry with our bodies? We will look at these questions that inform literary and anthropological texts, moving between forms (short fiction, poetry, ethnography, film, food recipes). Students will become familiar with how heads are loaded with symbolic meaning within and outside our material and lived experiences. They will familiarize themselves with why and how heads have captivated and occupied a significant portion of folklore and mythology.

Yet what should we make of this feeling when humanity threatens to destroy Nature through pollution and consumerist practices? How can we still conceive of this disarming natural might when our own power appears to trump it? This course aims to entertain possible answers to this question. The first part of the course will provide an introduction to the sublime as understood in the Western philosophical tradition. We will mainly rely on the work of Immanuel Kant, who arguably developed the most influential account of the sublime. In the second part of this course we will critically engage with this traditional definition of the sublime in light of the current environmental and climatic circumstances. We will discuss the work of several contemporary philosophers who have attempted to tackle the topic with the hope of resolving this apparent tension.","['AS Philosophy', 'AS Summer and Intersession Programs']",Krieger School of Arts and Sciences,1.00,

After reviewing broad descriptions of racist domination and antiracist resistance in the recent literature, we will turn to the Populists’ antiracist mobilization against Southern plantocracy in the 1890s, as well as to the views of Black intellectuals such as W.E.B. Du Bois, Anna Julia Cooper, and Booker T. Washington regarding the relations between labor and capital.

Then, we will move ahead to the 1960s to explore how labor leaders A. Philip Randolph and Bayard Rustin tried to shift the focus of antiracism after the Civil Rights Movement to persistent problems of poverty resulting from deindustrialization and other macroeconomic forces.

Finally, we will conclude with a discussion of Black feminist intersectional antiracism as formulated in the late 1970s, as well as contemporary debates over its insights and limits.

Ultimately, our goal will be to think broadly about the diﬀerent political movements mobilized through the language of race and their contribution to, or frustration of, the goal of political and economic liberation for all peoples.","['AS Political Science', 'AS Summer and Intersession Programs']",Krieger School of Arts and Sciences,1.00,

What does the study of politics look like if we center love and care in our research inquiry? When COVID-19 wreaked havoc globally, the conversation around love and care in their life-sustaining forms became central. Lockdowns reaffirmed private, heteronormative, and capitalist homes as a place of safety and stability. At the same time, it simultaneously concealed various co-habitation practices, feelings of loneliness due to isolation, as well as pervasive gender-based domestic violence. However, COVID-19 is not a moment of exception, but of an emergency in which the maintenance of life became paramount for all of us.   
 
This class focuses on life-sustaining and deeply political characteristics of love and care in the age of ever-impending crises from earthquakes to wildfires, floods to pandemics within academia and beyond. To do so, the first week of the class (re)conceptualizes love and care by predominantly drawing on feminist political thought. As such, the course aims to facilitate a collective discussion for the participants to analyze moral and political foundations of love and care by reflecting on readings and their everyday experiences. The second half of the class brings forth political science research that centers love and care as integral in analyzing political phenomena instead of the dominant focus on death, destruction, institutions, diplomacy, and so on. As such, the course creates a space to re-think how love and care can improve the political science inquiry.","['AS Political Science', 'AS Summer and Intersession Programs']",Krieger School of Arts and Sciences,1.00,

But for billions of people living under unfree governments, these developments are nothing new. Frontlines of Freedom surveys the global struggle for human rights and democracy, leveraging the expertise of foreign dissidents who have spent decades fighting against the trends that we in democratic countries are just coming to understand. Evan Mawarire, Zimbabwean pastor and leader of the #ThisFlag citizen's movement, who was jailed and tortured for his work, is the instructor. Throughout the course, dissidents from countries such as Iran, Russia, and China will feature as guest lecturers. Students will discuss how oppressive regimes maintain their power by suppressing civic engagement and the role of the United States and other democracies in countering authoritarianism at home and abroad.","['AS Agora Institute', 'AS Summer and Intersession Programs']",Krieger School of Arts and Sciences,1.00,
Intersession 2024,,['Online'],31,Democratic Innovations,"Democracy rests on the idea of political equality and collective self-rule: sovereignty ultimately lies with the people. Yet the development of modern representative democracies has increasingly transferred political authority to elected representatives, executive organs of the state and supranational institutions. Citizens in democracies continue to exercise power over the life of their societies. Yet recent surveys indicate that citizens feel increasingly disempowered and have less confidence in their governments to tackle significant problems and provide effective solutions. How can we enhance civic participation and revitalize democratic governance? This course introduces students to a diverse range of democratic innovations that have taken place across the world to meet this challenge. We examine the advantages and drawbacks of proposals to grant electoral franchise to children, organize citizen assemblies, introduce participatory budgeting, appoint legislators by random selection and use popular referenda to reform our democracies. Students will read comparative analyses and concrete proposals as well as case studies drawn from Participedia <participedia.net>, an open-source platform for crowdsourcing and organizing information and data about democratic innovations around the world.","['AS Agora Institute', 'AS Summer and Intersession Programs']",Krieger School of Arts and Sciences,1.00,

However, what are its properties and how do we interact with different types of memories? Is remembering a biking trip last summer the same as knowing how to ride a bike? This intersession course aims to provide a brief interdisciplinary overview of the nature of memory and recent approaches to study it in psychology, neuroscience, and cognitive science.

As EEG has gained popularity in neural research, the importance of educating standardized best-practices has become paramount. Even if data is recorded cleanly, improper EEG pre-processing at one of many steps can result in unintended distortion of data, changing subsequent interpretations. This course will train students how to pre-process EEG data, focusing on the benefits, limitations, and cautions at each step of pre-processing. Students will learn to use the EEGLAB and ERPLAB toolboxes on MATLAB for pre-processing and plotting. All software is free for Johns Hopkins students.

Thinkers like the Scottish philosopher Lord Shaftesbury and the political economist Adam Smith argued that learning to understand and to feel the emotions of others through compassion or sympathy would not only benefit the individual, but also help resolve bigger societal issues. In this two-week course, we will acquaint ourselves with the philosophy of sentiments before moving on to investigate how this philosophy was adopted and exhibited by many important German writers committed to art in the public sphere. We will read poems by Klopstock, Goethe, and Schiller, and discuss how this theory was explored by composers of the time in the musical works of C.P.E.

policies and practices. The residual effect of policies from as early as the 19th century can be felt today (i.e. The Tuskegee Experiment), while the impact of modern practices (i.e.
Exclusionary zoning) have yet to be fully uncovered. How exactly are these “curses” passeddown? Are what does it imply about human dynamics when we use this word? More centrally,
what is the process by which (individual) beliefs and practices become (collective) policies, and can we prevent this from happening?
We will explore answers to these questions and more through the examination of three case studies (health, education, housing) in Baltimore City and beyond. Through popular media
analysis, narrative stories, podcasts, readings, and community-based visits, students will interrogate the 2024 JHU Common Question, “What is repair?”, in the context of preventing
detrimental generational impacts.","['AS Public Health Studies', 'AS Summer and Intersession Programs']",Krieger School of Arts and Sciences,1.00,

Intersession 2024,,['Online'],12,Self-Care & Storytelling for Public Health Professionals,"What role do storytelling and narrative writing play in public health and medicine? What is the importance of self-care for public health professionals? What are the various ways that self-care can look? And how does storytelling play into self-care? This course will explore the answers to all of these questions.
 
In health and medicine, we often turn to authority figures and experts for the answers to problems, whether those be individuals such as doctors or government organizations such as the NIH or CDC. This paradigm often creates a dichotomy between patient and practitioner. What is missing in this paradigm is that patients and community members also have answers—answers that can inform the root causes of health issues as well as public health policy and practice. Storytelling and narrative writing are critical methods for uncovering these answers and for building a rapport among patients, practitioners, and communities.
 
Storytelling is also a powerful tool for self-care and healing, which are necessary ingredients for success in public health professions. This course will give you permission (read: require you!) to engage in daily self-care and reflect on your self-care activities.
 
Classes will include a combination of daily ice breakers, discussions, journaling activities, and a personal health improvement project, all of which will give us an opportunity to reflect on our life experiences and aspirations, help us better understand ourselves and one another, and equip us to be even stronger public health professionals.
 
In addition to being instructive, this class is going to be fun! It will be a safe space to talk about pretty much anything that’s on your mind.

Using examples drawn primarily from American and Japanese animated cartoons, German expressionism, French surrealism, and the Soviet avant garde, we will approach these texts with an eye toward animation’s capacity to mobilize wonder for both utopian and ideological ends. In approaching these texts, we’ll consider historical perspectives from filmmakers, critics, and theorists like Jean Epstein, Walter Benjamin, Sergei Eisenstein, and Imamura Taihei together with more recent scholarly interventions by (among others) Tom Gunning, Miriam Hansen, Nicholas Sammond, Donald Crafton, Sianne Ngai, Mel Y.

(1) How do animated media re-present, renew, and rework traditional philosophical problems, including questions of ontology, aesthetics, representation, identity, difference, and becoming? What new problems do animated media raise for philosophy that have attracted the interest of contemporary philosophers and media scholars? (2) Can animation itself do philosophy, and if so, how does it compare to other genres of expression like the Platonic dialogue, the Cartesian meditation, the treatise, and the philosophical novel? What are the promises and pitfalls of reading animation in this manner? (3) How do different forms of animated media—cel and stop motion, cinematic and televisual, artistic and commercial, analog and digital—refract and reframe philosophical inquiry? In approaching these questions, we’ll consider a wide variety of classical and contemporary examples from international animation history supplemented by perspectives from both film and animation theorists and media philosophers including Henri Bergson, Sergei Eisenstein, Erwin Panofsky, Andre Bazin, Stanley Cavell, Gilles Deleuze, Joon-Yang Kim, Hannah Frank, Thomas Lamarre, John Durham Peters, Sara Ahmed, and Ryan Pierson.

Intersession 2024,,['Online'],51,MIEF Applied Research Project,"Being a successful professional involves providing reliable answers to practical questions.  Obtaining reliable answers benefits from two components.  First, one needs a theoretical framework used to organize the data.  Second, one needs a suitable statistical method to summarize the implications and properties of the data so as to develop an intelligible answer to the question at hand.

Unfortunately, there is no “cookbook” available that will turn an amateur into a successful professional.  So this course adopts a case-study approach by focusing on two important questions: How can one measure the degree of international capital mobility and how can one determine the extent to which a particular the exchange rate for a particular currency is misaligned.

In addition to becoming familiar with these two subjects, students develop the habit of asking two important questions for professional life: How do you know and what is the alternative?    A successful applied research project integrates these two questions into providing reliable answers.
