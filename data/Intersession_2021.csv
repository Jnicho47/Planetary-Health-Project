Intersession 2021,,['Online'],33,B'More: Nutrition and Community,"Eating is more than just grabbing a meal; it’s a fundamental part of our social fabric. In fact, 3 times a day / 7 days a week we have the opportunity to build social connections, explore new tastes through culinary adventures, and support the local farming economy by eating local - all while consuming good nutrition for our optimal mental and physical performance.","['AS Biology', 'AS Summer and Intersession Programs']",Krieger School of Arts and Sciences,1.00,

Intersession 2021,,['Online'],12,From Hopkins to Health:  Finding Your Fit in the Health Ecosystem,"As we’ve seen this past year, ‘health’ is an all-encompassing term that stretches into many areas of the lives of individuals in communities, nations and global populations. Figuring out where one fits in the health ecosystem requires both self-reflection and exploration to understand how knowledge and roles intersect and connect to serve health needs. This course will use the processes and mindsets of Life Design to help students explore careers in the fields of medicine, allied health, public health, and healthcare.
Through the use of virtual treks, alumni visits, and experimental learning exercises and self-reflection, students will prototype possible careers and find their fit within the health ecosystem.","['AS Biology', 'AS Summer and Intersession Programs']",Krieger School of Arts and Sciences,1.00,
Intersession 2021,,['Online'],12,"Finding Your ""Why"" in Medicine","Often pre-med students are so focused on the “how” of getting into medical school that they don’t take the time to reflect upon “why” they want to become a doctor in the first place. With so many required courses, necessary clinical and research experiences, and expected leadership and extracurricular involvement, taking the time to understand one’s values and motivations is a challenge. This course will use the methods of Life Design to help students empathize with their own experiences, connect to alumni working in medicine to better understand the broader field, and articulate their own answer to “why medicine?” so that they are not only a stronger medical school applicant, but also a more self-aware and effective future physician.","['AS Biology', 'AS Summer and Intersession Programs']",Krieger School of Arts and Sciences,1.00,

Intersession 2021,,['Online'],12,Ancient Genetics,"Ancient Philosophy is almost inevitably associated with geometry, cosmogony, and ethics.  But from the 5th century on, we also have a vibrant discourse about concepts of “Generation”, a collective term describing topics like procreation, heredity, and embryology.  We will touch upon various issue like “What is science”, “Empiricism vs. Imagination”, “Origin of Seed and Embryo”, “Preformation vs. Epigenesis”, and “Contribution of Man and Woman to life” and trace them from antiquity to the modern era.","['AS Classics', 'AS Summer and Intersession Programs']",Krieger School of Arts and Sciences,1.00,
Intersession 2021,,['Online'],12,Classics and the Force of English Poetry,"Our aim is to chart the trajectory of Classical poetry through English-language poetry, observing how English poets are shaped by (and indeed reshape) Greco-Roman poetry. We will read touchstone ancient poems (in Latin/Greek or plain translation) by Homer, Sappho, Virgil, Catullus, and Horace alongside selections from Pope, Milton, Campion, Wordsworth, Tennyson, Ernest Dowson, Frost, Christopher Logue, and Anne Carson. We will supplement poetry with linguistic/translation theory by Saussure, Ezra Pound, T.S. Eliot, and C.H. Sisson.","['AS Classics', 'AS English', 'AS Summer and Intersession Programs']",Krieger School of Arts and Sciences,1.00,
Intersession 2021,,['Online'],12,Disease and Greco-Roman Cultural Imagination,"This class explores ancient medicine, particularly, experiences with disease as sites of culture, identity, and imagination in the ancient Mediterranean. Contrary to the solid marbled bodies we associate with antiquity, the reality is that just like all bodies, especially those in a pre-modern world, Romans and Greeks were vulnerable to disease. The art of antiquity exhibits symptoms of this. This class approaches disease both as a scientific phenomenon and as one which provokes questions about how much culture mediates the disease in
question, particularly as sites to enter into more specific cultural discourses. It moves through several artistic encounters with disease, from the rotting of corpses at Troy and the beginnings of epic poetry in Homer, the Athenain plague and the beginnings of historiography in Thucydides, and a Roman plague and the beginnings of illness narratives in the rhetorician Aelius Aristides. Each of these ‘cases’ served to pose questions about value and politics. Just as we are familiar with art today reflecting on anxieties over COVID-19 through
particular genres, Zoom horror movies for instance, art and literature served a similar function in antiquity, both engaging with real experiences of disease and doing so through specific kinds of genres and discourses. This class introduces students to the ancient Mediterranean as a place which resonates with the present concerns of our own cultural moment.","['AS Classics', 'AS Medicine, Science and the Humanities', 'AS Summer and Intersession Programs']",Krieger School of Arts and Sciences,1.00,
Intersession 2021,,['Online'],12,"The Epistle as an ""Image of the Soul"":  Letter-Writing in the Greco-Roman World","When did people start to write letters to each other? Which was their purpose? Also, how did a letter look like at those times? Which was the physical support of an epistle in ancient Greece, and Rome (and Egypt, too)? Epistolography in Greco-Roman antiquity was both a refined art that has remained testified in numerous literary collections, and an enormously widespread practice, that crossed the boundaries of social status, educational levels, ages, genders, and also literary genres. Interesting to any and all people, it was practiced by the aristocrats as well as the slaves, by the soldiers as well as women... and even by children! In this course we will read (in English translation) a surprisingly wide and multifaceted amount of letters and epistles, and through them we will (respectfully) enter into the personal worlds of both the most and the least renowned letter-writers of Egypt, Greece, Italy... and beyond.","['AS Classics', 'AS Modern Languages and Literatures', 'AS Summer and Intersession Programs']",Krieger School of Arts and Sciences,1.00,
Intersession 2021,,['Online'],12,History of Libraries & Libraries of History: Books and Their Places from Antiquity to Modern Times,"In a historical era when books as vehicles for the transmission of knowledge are by some put into discussion, even to the point of questioning the usefulness of their very existence in the paper format that we all know, it seems even more important than ever to dig into the long and fantastic story of how the books were born (and where, when, and why) and how (and where, and why) they managed to cross the eras.  A tasty survey of this process’s stages, and the parallel virtual visit to the most celebrated and most extraordinary libraries that history has encountered, will lead the students into a world much more vivacious and sparkling than one would imagine, a world – we may say – of human magic. A world that has probably something to tell us still nowadays.","['AS Classics', 'AS History', 'AS Summer and Intersession Programs']",Krieger School of Arts and Sciences,1.00,
Intersession 2021,,['Online'],12,Stems for STEM:  The Greek and Latin Roots of English,"Did you know that over 60 percent of all English words have Greek or Latin origins? In this course, we focus on how English scientific terms derive from classical languages. You will learn to recognize, translate and use some of the most important Greek and Latin roots found in the vocabulary of the sciences and technology. In addition to expanding and consolidating your vocabulary and your knowledge of scientific terminology, you will also learn skills that will help you tackle some of the most common standardized tests, such as the GRE and the GMAT. No prior knowledge of Greek or Latin is required.","['AS Classics', 'AS History', 'AS Medicine, Science and the Humanities', 'AS Summer and Intersession Programs']",Krieger School of Arts and Sciences,1.00,
Intersession 2021,,['Online'],12,"Puzzles, Paradoxes, and Reasoning Fallacies: Insights from Philosophy, Language, and Psychology","Puzzles and paradoxes have played a pivotal role in the development of philosophy, mathematics, and logic due to their ability to cast new light on familiar concepts and to reveal inconsistencies in seemingly rigorous formal systems. Many of these puzzles date back to ancient times, but they are far from being a matter of history: the questions we will explore in this class are actively debated by researchers today. These questions include: Can something be true and false at the same time? Why can we understand a sentence without a determinate meaning? Is someone tall if their height is 5’7’’? Are humans rational agents?

We will see that the answers vary not only depending on how we approach these fundamental questions, but who approaches them. While most of the puzzles and paradoxes presented in this course are rooted in philosophical tradition, they have inspired scientific inquiry across many disciplines — including linguistics, psychology, and cognitive science. The goal of this course is both to see how one question can be re-interpreted through the lens of different scientific fields, and how these fields can be brought together to reach a deeper understanding of the original question.","['AS Cognitive Science', 'AS Summer and Intersession Programs']",Krieger School of Arts and Sciences,2.00,

To do so in an entertaining (hopefully!) way, we will use episodes from Star Trek series (The Original Series, Next Generation, Deep Space Nine, etc.) to explore the complicated nature of diplomacy in (fictitious) praxis. While borne of the Cold War Great Power Competition between the US and USSR and mostly optimistic about the liberal internationalism promoted by the US, Star Trek over the years has dealt with complex social and political issues relevant to the study of IR to this day. One of the main contentions of the course is that the study of International Relations can benefit from exploring hypotheses in alternate futures. Each class meeting will be paired with one episode from a Star Trek series and students are expected to view the episode as well as complete all class readings prior to meeting. The focus of these comparisons is not to see how the IR themes covered in the syllabus play out in a contained story.

They drew on reggae, krautrock, glam rock, disco, jazz, prog, and other experimental forms of music to create a new genre to induce a different set of affects and public feelings that differed from punk’s one note angst. Equally urgent for many of these bands was the dire political landscape of the late 1970s and early 1980s: the disaffection with revolutionary politics, the collapse of global economy, postindustrial cityscapes, the rise of the Anglo-American Right, apocalyptic Evangelicalism, street fights with neo-fascists, a nascent neo-liberalism, nuclear meltdowns, and Soviet war in Afghanistan. This course will explore postpunk’s political response to these series of political crises by listening to their music against the background of historical, literary, and political theory texts that these bands drew inspiration from and were in dialogue with. We will do so with the aim of thinking and feeling our way through the crises of our political present.","['AS Political Science', 'AS Summer and Intersession Programs']",Krieger School of Arts and Sciences,1.00,

Islamophobia is the institutionalization of policies at the structural level to disempower Muslims access to societal privileges. The understanding of Muslim identity as a racial group instead of as a faith groups posited as the racialization of Muslims in America. Following tenets of critical race theory, this racialization has impacts on the mental health of Muslims as a minority group. Through course lectures, in-class discussions, and group assignments, students will learn a few additional theories about the mechanisms that cause disparities in the mental health of American Muslims. The final day of the course will be reserved for a TED-style talk of the group assignments, which will involve a scientific literature review on selected journal articles on Islamophobia and Muslim mental health. Student presentations will be assessed by peers on: how the content enhances their current learning in Islamic Studies, how theories are applied to explain the mental health experiences of Muslim Americans, and how significantly the chosen topics contribute to innovation in the field of minority mental health.","['AS Islamic Studies', 'AS Summer and Intersession Programs']",Krieger School of Arts and Sciences,2.00,

Ice in its contained form, however, provides the ground for pleasurable entertainment and every year in December outdoor ice rinks open in central plazas all over the world. As Kierkegaard’s ‘Jewel on Thin Ice Parable’ illustrates, ice skating captures the tension between art, nature, and society in the modern age, not least symbolized through the ice skate with its machine-made steel blade. On the basis of Burke’s and Kant’s ideas of the sublime and beautiful, this class aims to give an overview on the poetics of skating as an aesthetic experience of transcendence and a metaphor for poetic composition by studying an excerpt of Wordsworth’s “The Prelude”, poems by Lee-Hamilton, Kirsch, Goethe and Klopstock (the latter both passionate ice skaters). We will also analyze how skating scenes can illustrate the idea of “breaking the ice” more or less literally in selected scenes from Anna Karenina, Little Women, and Catcher in the Rye. By comparing Disney’s motion picture Frozen and H. C. Andersen’s “The Snow Queen”, we will discuss the aesthetic representation of self-expression and thawed emotions.

Media Portraits of Protests in Hong Kong,"Public protests in Hong Kong date back to British colonial rule and have evolved from the sporadic, although bloody riots of the 1960s into the more recent protests of 2014 and 2019 with up to two million people marching. Hong Kong’s unique place in colonial history, and its democratic aspirations offer an extraordinary opportunity to learn and discuss whether, over time, representations of protests in both Hong Kong and non-Hong Kong based, English language newspapers have become more polarized, and whether eventual changes in the reporting of the protests may have influenced Hong Kong citizens’ legitimization of, and support for the protests, and/or any action by the authorities vis a vis protests. The short course will:
•examine coverage of five episodes of protests: the 2003 Article 23 Subversion Legislation; the 2007 Save the Star Ferry Pier Campaign; the 2012 Anti-moral Education Protest; 2014 Occupy Central; and the 2019 Anti-extradition Law Protests in the South China Morning Post and China Daily (Hong Kong edition), The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal, Financial Times, The Times, and The Guardian.
•use a news agenda setting approach, content and discourse analysis techniques to learn about differences in linguistic representations across newspapers; whether these differences may be reflective of different political positions which, in turn may result in a positive or negative bias towards how protests are understood, justified, and tolerated by citizens and authorities.
•Discuss the historical context and the response to the various protest events by the HK government and the PRC.","['AS Agora Institute', 'AS East Asian Studies', 'AS International Studies']",Krieger School of Arts and Sciences,1.00,

How can I demonstrate I am a leader?” Let’s explore these questions together. Leadership at Hopkins is not confined to those holding a President or Vice President title in a student organization. We can lead anywhere – in the classroom, on the field, in the lab, in our student organizations generally, in our dorms, and more. Rather than being involved in many things on a surface level, let’s dig deeper together to determine what leadership means to us and how we can create an intentional plan, using design thinking principles, to gain valuable skills, experiences, and connections and develop exactly how we hope to while at Hopkins. Students will be challenged to answer the question, “What experiences will serve you best?” and use these answers to design forward. We will  consider how to tell our leadership stories to unlock new opportunities that are part of our leadership plan, such as internships, shadowing, research, and more. Additionally, we will practice networking with alumni to learn more about their leadership journey and apply their insights to our own plans.","['AS Summer and Intersession Programs', 'EN Center for Leadership Education']",Whiting School of Engineering,1.00,

Intersession 2021,,['Online'],51,MIEF Applied Research Project,"Being a successful professional involves providing reliable answers to practical questions.  Obtaining reliable answers benefits from two components.  First, one needs a theoretical framework used to organize the data.  Second, one needs a suitable statistical method to summarize the implications and properties of the data so as to develop an intelligible answer to the question at hand.

Unfortunately, there is no “cookbook” available that will turn an amateur into a successful professional.  So this course adopts a case-study approach by focusing on two important questions: How can one measure the degree of international capital mobility and how can one determine the extent to which a particular the exchange rate for a particular currency is misaligned.

In addition to becoming familiar with these two subjects, students develop the habit of asking two important questions for professional life: How do you know and what is the alternative?    A successful applied research project integrates these two questions into providing reliable answers.
