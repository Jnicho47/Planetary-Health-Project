Summer 2023,,['Homewood Campus'],21,Decoding College Writing,"This course examines three broad types of writing students will encounter at and beyond Hopkins: narrative writing, analytical writing, and technical writing. Each has its own implications within the walls of JHU, from research papers to creative projects, but each will extend to the opportunities students pursue outside of academia. Above all, this course demystifies the idea that some writers just “have it” by decoding the processes that lead to great writing and building students’ confidence in written expression to carry forward into their studies and professional pursuits. (Only students in the Hop-In Program are permitted to enroll in this course.)","['AS Summer and Intersession Programs', 'AS Writing Program']",Krieger School of Arts and Sciences,3.00,

Summer 2023,,['Online'],41,"Population Genomics: Evolution, Extinction & Disease","Population genomics is the study of the structure, function, and variability of the entire genetic complement of organisms considered on a population scale. By examining how gene variants change in structure and frequency in populations over time, we can study the process of evolution and how it contributes to biodiversity and the formation of new species; this information can be used to increase the efficacy of conservation efforts. By studying gene variants underlying diseases at the scale of populations, we can better diagnose complex polygenic diseases like cancer. This course introduces the fundamentals of population genomics and provides an overview of the subfields of evolutionary genomics, conservation genomics, and medical genomics.","['AS Biology', 'AS Summer and Intersession Programs']",Krieger School of Arts and Sciences,1.00,

It asks whether the form of the novel is the appropriate form or technology for the representation of laughter. Furthermore, it interrogates the limits of the social world as they are presented by authors who explore and argue for laughter as an outlet, as an opening to possible worlds and to alternative uses of language.  Lastly, we will consider if laughter as a literary form expresses a type of consciousness or model of cognition—to this end we will view episodes of Monty Python.","['AS English', 'AS Summer and Intersession Programs']",Krieger School of Arts and Sciences,3.00,
Summer 2023,,['Homewood Campus'],21,(Very) Contemporary African American Literature,"This course is listed as a ""lecture"" when it should be a ""seminar"" / NEW DESCRIPTION SHOULD READ AS FOLLOWED: In recent years, scholars of African American literature have attempted to define the literature of the “post-civil rights era"" in a number of ways, with some arguing that the collective project of African American literature may be over. This course provides an introduction to frameworks for thinking about contemporary African American literature through close attention to novels and poems by African American writers from the last twenty years as well as related secondary criticism. Some critical approaches to contemporary African American literature include focusing on characteristics assigned to literary postmodernism more broadly (irony, metafictionality, parody, etc.); (black) structures of feeling; the contemporary slave narrative; and the Black Lives Matter movement. The range of relatively understudied primary texts we will look at should give us a chance to consider each of these perspectives alongside arguments for the pastness of African American literature. The aim of this course is to familiarize you not only with these literary critical debates, but also a complicated, evolving body of literature that will encourage you to think carefully about the relation between history, literary form, politics, and race.","['AS Center for Africana Studies', 'AS English']",Krieger School of Arts and Sciences,3.00,

Through this examination, we will develop an understanding of how contemporary climate fictions participate in climate change discourse, politics, and the social struggles that both underpin and are exacerbated by climate change. By the end of the course, students will be able to define ecofascism, its politics, and its ideas. Students will analyze how climate fictions critique and amplify ecofascist ideology and politics.

Through this examination, we will develop an understanding of how contemporary climate fictions participate in geoengineering discourse and politics, and how geoengineering relates to social struggles that both underpin and are exacerbated by climate change.

In this course, we shall view select episodes of The Crown in context, engaging with both the history behind the series and other cultural depictions of the royals. Ultimately, we shall seek to uncover the character and ideology of monarchy across media, querying the motives and meaning of representing the royals on stage and screen. At the conclusion of this course, students will be able to critically engage with theatrical and filmic depictions of the British monarchy as both singular objects and expressions of a broader tradition. Through attentive reading and viewing, students will cultivate skills in assessing the sociopolitical contexts of dramatic and cinematic texts and synthesizing their cultural resonances.

Select professional screenplays will be read and analyzed — and clips from select films viewed — to further explore what works well on the page, and how it translates to working well onscreen.

Summer 2023,,['Homewood Campus'],11,Better Brain Fitness and Performance Through Neuroplasticity: How To Improve Your Memory,"Recent scientific evidence shows that our brain has a great deal of malleability at any age and that our lifestyle choices play an important role in shrinking or growing different parts of our brain. Factors such as poor sleep, obesity, anxiety, and poor diet lead to accumulating shrinkage in the brain while even three months of exercise, brain training, meditation, and optimal sleep can grow the brain. You can learn to apply these new discoveries into your day-to-day life in order to improve your memory, attention, organizational skills, and overall brain vitality. Much of your learning in this course will happen during classes. Each lecture is followed by a 10-minute engaging and fun discussion session to make sure you have grasped the main concepts for that presentation.","['AS Neuroscience', 'AS Summer and Intersession Programs']",Krieger School of Arts and Sciences,3.00,

Summer 2023,,['Online'],85,Introduction to Political Theory:  Power and Authority,"This course provides an introduction to Western political theory, focusing on theories and practices of power and authority. We will examine the extent to which it is possible to describe, theorize, and make visible how political power operates, and power's relationship to authority, knowledge, truth, and political freedom. A strong tradition of political thought argues that people's consent is what makes political power legitimate. But what if one of the most insidious workings of power is its ability to prevent us from telling the difference between consent and coercion? Can power allow certain authorities to effectively brainwash people? If so, does that mean that those who obey authority should no longer be held politically responsible for their actions? Does the coercive power of norms and conformity prevent any robust practice of freedom? What role (if any) should state power play in negotiating questions of morality, religion and sexuality? Lastly, we will be haunted by a related question: can political theories of power make people free, or are those theories implicated in the very coercion they profess to oppose? Classes will be a combination of lectures, critical discussions/debates, film screenings and presentations. Throughout the term, you will sharpen your ability to formulate coherent written and spoken arguments by organizing and supporting your thoughts in a persuasive manner. An important part of this skill will include the ability to wrestle with complex and controversial political problems that lack any single answer. The stakes of these problems will be brought to life by the political examples we will study, and made legible by looking through the theoretical lenses of diverse thinkers.","['AS Political Science', 'AS Summer and Intersession Programs']",Krieger School of Arts and Sciences,3.00,

How has the tradition of civil disobedience changed over time, and how does it function in contemporary society? In what ways does the advent of the digital and internet age complicate contemporary civil disobedience?

Summer 2023,,['Homewood Campus'],11,"Racism, International Politics and Black Lives Matter","Scholars of international politics assumes racism to be an issue of domestic politics and thus not of consequence to the study of international politics. Meanwhile, scholars of American politics usually approach civil rights struggles as domestic phenomena that do not require an examination from the perspective of international politics. This course introduces students to the ways in which racial politics have both domestic and international dimensions. A key aim of the course is to provide a recent historical narrative of racial politics which culminates in an engagement with Black Lives Matter as an intrinsically domestic and international phenomenon.","['AS Center for Africana Studies', 'AS Political Science', 'AS Summer and Intersession Programs']",Krieger School of Arts and Sciences,3.00,

No longer are museums measured and judged solely by their internal resources—collections, endowments, facilities, and staff—but rather by the external benefits and value they create for individuals and communities. Growing numbers of museums are learning to make their organizations more meaningful and relevant by involving their communities in ongoing planning and decision-making. They are reframing museum activities to focus on what matters to their communities. By getting involved in community challenges and developing new partnerships, they are identifying underserved audiences and creating memorable visitor experiences. As museums begin this journey towards community engagement, they are initiating and facilitating social change and moving towards social entrepreneurship.

This course provides a comprehensive overview of public history as a modern, engaging field of practice, with a skill-building focus on digital storytelling as the key tool for reaching existing audiences and building new ones. It is now a heavily democratic field in the sense that it can be practiced anywhere, by anyone — and therein lies additional challenges for museum and public history professionals. Consequently, we will cover the fundamental elements of practicing public history — including fundraising, governance, interpretation, and countering false narratives — while also introducing students to the process of digital storytelling, which merges the strength of visual and audio media with the power of narrative storytelling to produce informative and persuasive history-related content. By the end of the course, students will have a working knowledge of the ways that modern public history practitioners understand their roles and leave with a toolkit of new media skills to help them shape their own careers.","['AAP Cultural Heritage Management', 'AAP Museum Studies']",Krieger School of Arts and Sciences Advanced Academic Programs,3.00,

Summer 2023,,['Online'],81,NAGPRA: Repatriation as Compliance or Ethical Practice,"In the United States, the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA) outlines a process by which government agencies (and those who receive government funding) must return human remains and sacred objects to those who claim them. Repatriation is a complicated process because it means something different in almost every case. One of its earliest claims took 20-years to resolve. In 2017, the Ancient One was returned to the tribes of the Columbia River for reburial after DNA tests proved the relationship that tribes had claimed all along. But now reproductions of the Ancient One’s skull are being sold by a company that holds the copyright. When those from outside the culture to which he was returned can examine and/or profit from a replica, the distinction between compliance with the law and the ethics of return is clear. Outside of the United States, few repatriation laws exist and many argue that institutions like The British Museum are the best places to protect world heritage. Is providing care of and access to human remains and cultural objects preferable over returning heritage to those from which it was taken? In this course, we examine repatriation claims around the globe in order to critique NAGPRA and establish a compliance toolkit. Where NAGPRA doesn’t apply, heritage professionals can use the successes and failures of past repatriations, and a firm grounding in ethics, to make repatriation decisions. Nothing in NAGPRA prohibits practitioners from exceeding its scope and seeking out opportunities to build relationships with descendent communities even when repatriation is not required by law.","['AAP Cultural Heritage Management', 'AAP Museum Studies']",Krieger School of Arts and Sciences Advanced Academic Programs,3.00,

Summer 2023,,['Off site (Not JHU)'],91,Discovering Science History in “The Athens of the North”,"Empiricism, skepticism, reason – ideas central to modern science (and science writing)--flourished during the Scottish Enlightenment of the 18th and early 19th centuries. At Scottish universities and intellectual societies, thinkers and scientists such as James Hutton, Joseph Black, Mary Somerville, and James Watt advanced the fields of chemistry, medicine, engineering, and others.

This course will travel back through the centuries to visit key sites and figures of this seminal period. Home base will be Edinburgh, named in the 18th century as “The Athens of the North” for its Greek-inspired architecture and explosion of new ideas. Activities will include talks with historians of science and medicine and visits to sites important to science heritage, such as the Royal College of Physicians (est. 1681) and Arthur’s Seat volcano, where geologist James Hutton’s research helped reveal that Earth is billions of years old. The group will also contemplate more recent Scottish science history (e.g., the cloning of Dolly the Sheep).

Discussions will explore science history’s place in today’s science writing: As science and science journalism move apace, why bother to investigate science history? How and when might looking backward enrich a story about a contemporary scientific development? Moreover, science history itself proffers a trove of fascinating untold stories – How can writers find such historical gems?

Students will also critically examine the writer’s role in reckoning with historical events now perceived as negative. As we “fix our eye on the now distant point from which we have drifted” (Sir Walter Scott), what can we ascertain about that starting point, including its more troubling aspects? Finally, the course will provide practical guidance, including lessons on searching archives and pitching history-grounded science stories for publication. As a final assignment, students will write a science story that makes use of historical sources.",['AAP Science Writing'],Krieger School of Arts and Sciences Advanced Academic Programs,4.00,

Summer 2023,,['Washington DC Center'],52,Deep Learning with Unstructured Data,"With the enterprises’ usage of Information and Communication Technology (ICT), a huge amount of data is being generated every second. Much of this big data is unstructured and loosely connected. Enterprise technology managers are often called upon to support decision making based on information that resides in this unstructured data. Managers of technology need to be able to support such decision making by delivering analytical applications via enterprise wide APIs and secure corporate networks. The ability to organize large repositories of unstructured data and run analytical applications on them is key creating an effective information architecture for the modern corporation. This course prepares students to manage enterprise technology needs by acquiring advanced data analytics skills for driving business insights from large amounts of unstructured data using network analysis and deep learning.

Summer 2023,,['Online'],81,Introduction to Financial Derivatives,"This is the first of a two-course sequence devoted to the mathematical modeling of securities and the markets in which they are created and exchanged. The basic cash, hybrid, and derivative instruments are reviewed and set in a rigorous mathematical context. This includes equities, bonds, options, forwards, futures, and swaps, as well as their dealer, overthe-counter, and exchange environment. Models of the term structure of interest rates, spot rates and, the forward rate curve are treated; derived from cash instruments (e.g., bonds and interest rates like LIBOR) as well as from derivatives (such as Eurodollar futures and swaps). Principles of static, discrete, continuous and dynamic probabilistic models for derivative analysis (including the Weiner process, Ito’s Lemma, and an introduction to risk-neutral valuation) are applied to develop the 
binomial tree approach to option valuation, the Black-ScholesMerton differential equation, and the Black-Scholes formulas for option pricing.

They learn to identify unmet medical device needs through direct observations in a variety of clinical settings including the hospital ward and operating room, interviews (with patients, doctors, nurses, hospital administration), literature survey, and more. Concurrently, they learn the process of filtering all observations to a few valid medical device opportunities by assessing the market size, intellectual property landscape, regulatory framework, and competitor dynamics in addition to the clinical impact that such a device could have. 

The ability to identify a relevant medical device need is an important first step in the medical device innovation cycle; this course aims to provide students with practical hands- on training in that process.

We start by exploring the legal and regulatory environment that influences and supports cyber-based activities and programs, focusing on multidisciplinary or integrated views of enterprise risk management. We will address key risk management issues from the legal and cybersecurity aspects and analyze legal/ cybersecurity issues in several of the critical infrastructure sectors, such as the financial services, healthcare and public health, and transportation systems sectors. We also review legal and regulatory compliance issues to address cybersecurity risk management for systems development, acquisition, and operation. This includes material impacting the manner in which the cyber community operates, for example, FITARA (Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act) Enhancement Act of 2017. We then review the authoritative guidance provided by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework. The Framework is voluntary for the sixteen critical information sectors and mandatory for the federal government, hence the focus on NIST. Risk management threat detection and avoidance is analyzed from an integrated legal/cybersecurity perspective, including system objectives to avert legal liability and minimize enterprise and human loss. Examples address financial services, healthcare and public health, and transportation (mobile devices and autonomous vehicles) systems, and cyber-physical systems (CPS) or Internet of Things (IoT). The overall constitutional and statutory basis within which all cyber law and policy operates is identified and reviewed.","['PE Engineering Management', 'PE Information Systems Engineering']",Whiting School of Engineering for Professionals,3.00,
Summer 2023,,['Online'],8VL,Ethics in Intelligent Systems,"This course is to fortify and enrich the values-assessment and critical thinking skills of engineers as they grapple with the numerous ethical challenges in their professional and personal lives. To that end, the course will define and delineate some global, macro-level concepts and approaches to ethics; move on to review some ethical issues unique to engineers as they apply intelligent technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning to developing complex systems; and finally present some finite cases studies and concrete situations by which to apply these ethical principles. This class will stimulate students to help identify a critical thinking zeitgeist and framework by which to filter, absorb and resolve complex ethical problems and questions in both their professions and at the personal level. This class will be completely value-neutral and hence devoid of any one overarching governing ethical school of thought; thus, we are ecumenical in our approaches. Having said that, the IEEE ethically aligned design standards are noteworthy and very salutary to any exploration.

In this course, we start by examining some basic issues with regard to risk analysis as well as why forecasts often fall short before examining three broad issues: country structural fragility; problems with collective action policymaking; and operational breakdowns. The first looks at how the sociopolitical and institutional dynamics of a country affects its evolution. The second looks at how the policy formulation process works and why it often yields a less than ideal result. The third looks at the challenges of implementation. As such, the class focuses more on the risks that face countries than on how particular risks might impact corporations or NGOs, though the latter is also examined. The two types of risks are related but are not identical (e.g., regulatory changes may be good for a country, but bad for a company or NGO). We conclude by examining how to prioritize and mitigate risk. Each class aims to provide students with a set of frameworks to think about and assess these issues. Students all get a chance to work on case studies to develop their skills.

Depending on individual motivation, commitment, experience and language background, the course should allow students to reach between the A1 (Breakthrough) A2 (Way stage) levels of the Common European Framework of Reference. The CEFR describes what a learner is supposed to be able to do in reading, listening, speaking and writing at each level, specifically:

A1. Can understand and use familiar everyday expressions and very basic phrases aimed at the satisfaction of needs of a concrete type. Can introduce him/herself and others and can ask and answer questions about personal details such as where he/she lives, people he/she knows and things he/she has. Can interact in a simple way provided the other person talks slowly and clearly and is prepared to help.

A2. Can understand sentences and frequently used expressions related to areas of most immediate relevance (e.g. very basic personal and family information, shopping, local geography, employment). Can communicate in simple and routine tasks requiring a simple and direct exchange of information on familiar and routine matters. Can describe in simple terms aspects of his/her background, immediate environment and matters in areas of immediate need.

The approach is communicative: priority will be given to the ability to express oneself meaningfully and to make oneself understood.

Language is always presented in context; grammar, phonology, lexis and all other features of actual language use in every-day situations are analyzed.

 The course intends to develop the four skills of listening, speaking, reading and writing, however the main focus will be on speaking and listening in order to give the students the opportunity to interact with native speakers as soon as possible and take advantage of living in Italy.","['SA Italian', 'SB Language']",Nitze School of Advanced International Studies,0.00,
