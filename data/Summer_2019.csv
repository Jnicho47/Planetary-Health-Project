Bush referred to the U.S. war on terror as a â€œcrusade,"""" the Islamic world erupted in protest.  The American media and public were stunned at how something, seemingly so distant, could trigger such a strong emotional response. Part of the problem is historiographical. Until recently, few Western historians writing about the Crusades included Arabic and Jewish sources in their analysis of the conflict. This had an almost immediate effect on the quality of information that was presented to students in American classrooms, where much of the narrative about the Crusades was Euro-centric. The basic idea behind this course is to expose students, through primary source readings, to both Christian, Muslim and Jewish perspectives on the Crusades.

Yet even while they provide vital assistance to millions of people in crisis, such organizations are beset by important paradoxes that hinder their capacity to create sustainable interventions.  They work to fill long-lasting needs, but are prone to moving quickly from one site to the next in search of the latest emergency.  They strive to be apolitical, yet are invariably influenced by the geopolitical agendas of global powers.  How do such contradictions arise, and what is their impact upon millions of aid recipients around the world?   Drawing on case studies from South Sudan to Haiti, this course addresses these contradictions by exploring how and why medical aid organizations attempt, and sometimes fail, to reconcile short-term goals, such as immediate life-saving, with long-term missions, such as public health programs and conflict resolution initiatives.","['AS International Studies', 'AS Public Health Studies', 'AS Sociology', 'AS Summer and Intersession Programs']",Krieger School of Arts and Sciences,3.00,

Summer 2019,,['Online'],81,"Renaissance Women: Portraits, Patrons, and Painters","This seminar will explore the artistic experience of women in Renaissance Italy. A large body of recent scholarship has sought to “recover those women...who have been erased from history in modern literature, rendered invisible or obscured by history or scholarship, as well as those who were overshadowed by male relatives, political accident, or spatial location” (Katherine A. McIver, preface to Wives, Widows, Mistresses and Nuns in Early Modern Italy). Drawing upon a consideration of both current research and primary sources, this course will investigate the role women played as the makers, the commissioners, and the subjects of art in Italy during the period from ca. 1250-1600. Among other issues, we will examine the constraints that limited women’s contribution to the arts in this period when women’s participation in public life were quite circumscribed, as well as the various means they found to overcome them. We will investigate what types of women were able to become artists. We will learn what categories of women were most likely to commission art, and what kinds of art they generally commissioned. Lastly, we will examine portraits of women, to understand what these representations tell us about the view of women in Renaissance society. Students will develop their own critical positions on the issues through a close reading of both texts and works of art, participation in online discussions, and in several substantial writing assignments.",['AAP Liberal Arts'],Krieger School of Arts and Sciences Advanced Academic Programs,3.00,

Summer 2019,,['Online'],81,American Political Theory and Practice,"Our purpose in this course is not to provide an account of the mechanics of American government, but to examine the principles that underlie those mechanics, and the way in which those principles change over time. In other words, we are going to examine the political philosophy that serves as a basis for the American regime (or regimes, if one is so inclined). This means that in addition to questions of justice and right we will examine how the thinkers of the Founding era understood the human being, and the sort of governmental structures that are built on this understanding. We will also consider the revolution in American politics that occurs in the 20th century. The progressive movement of the 20th century builds on a different view of human nature and metaphysics (originating in, but ultimately transcending, Hegelian Idealism), and therefore finds itself in tension with the principles of the Founding. This tension is one of the animating forces of American political partisanship today, so an understanding of the development of American political theory will help us to better understand political disagreements in our own day.

Deep Ecology asks deep questions and aims to bring about long-range goals in moving away from anthropocentrism to ecocentrism, calling for a major paradigm shift in perception, values, and lifestyles. Planetary and human survival is at stake due to climate change — this is humanity’s global ultimate concern. Scientists, environmental activists, and representatives of humanities agree that we need a new paradigm shift, that it is unsustainable to treat the living earth organism as an infinite resource of “energy.” Western environmental practices have been based on anthropocentric view of nature where humans occupy the top of the hierarchy in the chain of life. There is an urgent need for a new environmental ethic that will fundamentally reorient humans in their thinking and relating to the natural environment.

They are reframing museum activities to focus on what matters to their communities. By getting involved in community challenges and developing new partnerships, they are identifying underserved audiences and creating memorable visitor experiences. As museums begin this journey towards community engagement, they are initiating and facilitating social change and moving towards social entrepreneurship. This course includes the theory and skills of community engagement, drawing on both research and practice for examples.",['AAP Museum Studies'],Krieger School of Arts and Sciences Advanced Academic Programs,3.00,

Summer 2019,,['Online'],81,NAGPRA: Repatriation as Compliance or Ethical Practice,"In the United States, the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA) outlines a process by which government agencies (and those who receive government funding) must return human remains and sacred objects to those who claim them. Repatriation is a complicated process because it means something different in almost every case. One of its earliest claims took 20-years to resolve. In 2017, the Ancient One was returned to the tribes of the Columbia River for reburial after DNA tests proved the relationship that tribes had claimed all along. But now reproductions of the Ancient One’s skull are being sold by a company that holds the copyright. When those from outside the culture to which he was returned can examine and/or profit from a replica, the distinction between compliance with the law and the ethics of return is clear. Outside of the United States, few repatriation laws exist and many argue that institutions like The British Museum are the best places to protect world heritage. Is providing care of and access to human remains and cultural objects preferable over returning heritage to those from which it was taken? In this course, we examine repatriation claims around the globe in order to critique NAGPRA and establish a compliance toolkit. Where NAGPRA doesn’t apply, heritage professionals can use the successes and failures of past repatriations, and a firm grounding in ethics, to make repatriation decisions. Nothing in NAGPRA prohibits practitioners from exceeding its scope and seeking out opportunities to build relationships with descendent communities even when repatriation is not required by law.",['AAP Cultural Heritage Management'],Krieger School of Arts and Sciences Advanced Academic Programs,3.00,

Studying its principles, development, and decay is a requirement for understanding American politics and is as well a potential benefit to students of aspiring democracies throughout the world. For the separation of powers enables self-government, putting democratic principles of equality and liberty into practice while moderating the powers of majorities.

We will study the principles and practice of the separation of powers by examining how each elected branch of government protects its rights, while checking the rights of others. The separation of powers can be said to have produced a more just and moderate democratic form of government, but it has also occasioned the complaint that it has produced gridlock and incompetence. To investigate the strengths and drawbacks of the separation of powers, we will pay close attention to the classic texts advocating the separation of powers, such as The Federalist Papers; the great changes in American politics effected by the Civil War, the Progressive movement, and the New Deal; and the domestic and foreign policy debates in recent administrations. Special attention will be paid to the seminal opinions of the unelected branch of American government, the Supreme Court. 

The course will note in particular the contemporary challenges to the separation of powers, evidenced in the rise of the administrative state, the expanding powers of courts, and the growth of party government. We will also note instances of how parliamentary and presidential governments throughout the world might benefit from separation of powers principles.

For the United States the division of power between the Federal and State governments lies at the very heart of the American Constitution. At the same time disputes over the precise balance of Federal and State power has been a major fault line in American politics since Federalists and anti-Federalists at the time of the founding.  For Europe the destruction of two World Wars showed the destructive side of nationalism and acted as an impetus to leverage Europe’s common history and cultural inheritance to forge a supranational political and economic union dedicated to peace and prosperity.  Since the end of the Cold War and the Treaty of Maastricht the process of European integration has speeded up rapidly resulting in a common European currency as well as common legal and political institutions. At the same time concerns about the perceived loss of sovereignty, national identity, and democratic accountability have led in some places to backlashes against Brussels and resurgent nationalism.

Examining the upheavals is key to understanding how the landscape and laws of modern financial markets evolved and where they might be headed. <br></br>
 
With the Great Recession of 2007–2012, the United States experienced the biggest economic crisis and ensuing downturn since the crash of 1929 and Great Depression of the 1930s. While every boom-and-bust is unique, all share certain characteristics—most notably, the seemingly inexhaustible ability of humans to forget the lessons of financial history. This forgetfulness comes at great expense to society. This course provides a tour of the country’s major boom-and-bust-cycles, with a focus on last century, and particularly the last three decades, when such events became more numerous. After each debacle, laws and rules changed.

It begins by exploring the foundations of the energy and climate justice movements in terms of current and emerging issues, Accessibility and indigenous rights are examined for practical factors impacting effective implementation of projects.  Students are required to focus on the praxis of solutions for effective decision-making approaches for including diverse stakeholders as part of their management approach.  This course examines claims made by diverse groups along with the regulatory and government policy responses that address perceived inequity and injustice. The course will study the mechanisms that give rise to class, racial, ableism and other kinds of disparities that impact environmental decision-making which can be barriers to achieving the sustainability development goals that broadly involve these stakeholders. This includes the study of affected constituents, communities, industry, government, activists, policy makers, and scholars, allowing students to learn about the causes and consequences of inequitable distributions of benefits and hazards. Students will learn about various methods for researching climate and energy justice issues and strategies for formulating policies and collaborating with communities. In this course, students will review theories and perspectives through case studies of Black Americans, Latinas, Asians, disability, and indigenous communities. The class will focus mainly on the United States but will include aspects of international issues and perspectives through assignments. There will be flexible options for students to participate in game simulations on climate justice and sustainability issues and when possible, include international participants and guest speakers from these diverse communities.","['PE Climate, Energy, and Environmental Sustainability', 'PE Environmental Planning and Management']",Whiting School of Engineering for Professionals,3.00,

Summer 2019,,['East Baltimore Campus'],01,Identification and Validation of Medical Device Needs,"This course teaches the art and skill of identifying medical device opportunities by experiencing real world scenarios in an immersive clinical environment. Students rotate through multiple clinical disciplines and become part of the team of senior clinicians, surgeons, residents, fellows, nurses and medical technologists. 

They learn to identify unmet medical device needs through direct observations in a variety of clinical settings including the hospital ward and operating room, interviews (with patients, doctors, nurses, hospital administration), literature survey, and more. Concurrently, they learn the process of filtering all observations to a few valid medical device opportunities by assessing the market size, intellectual property landscape, regulatory framework, and competitor dynamics in addition to the clinical impact that such a device could have. 

The ability to identify a relevant medical device need is an important first step in the medical device innovation cycle; this course aims to provide students with practical hands- on training in that process.

Summer 2019,,['Homewood Campus'],15,Summer Immersion: Medicine & The Body: Exploring Narrative Mysteries,"Exploring Narrative Mysteries examines the profound and unexpected ways that the humanities intersect with medicine, science, and technology. It is a street with two-way traffic. Disease is a central concern in the human condition, recorded vividly in fiction, opera, and poetry, and studied in a variety of social sciences. Yet stories reside at the center of the medical experience, doctors and researchers often require the tools of consolation and inspiration possessed by the most compelling storytellers to be effective in their profession.

Students will be guided in this exploration by Lakshmi Krishnan, a researcher who has blazed paths of excellence in both medicine and the humanities. Krishnan is an alumna of Johns Hopkins School of Medicine (M.D., 2014), and a recipient of a Rhodes Scholarship, who took her Ph.D. in English Literature at the University of Oxford.


The course draws upon the resources offered by the world-renowned Johns Hopkins medical school, as well as the deep traditions of excellence in the university’s departments in the arts and sciences.

It is an opportunity for students to discover that the quality of the stories told by patients and doctors exerts a profound effect on our own health and the science of medicine itself. And they will emerge from the course – and many others offered by Johns Hopkins Summer Programs – energized by the possibilities of profound discovery across disciplines.

Summer 2019,,['Washington DC Center'],01,"Politics and Risk: Countries, Policies and Institutions","Politics affects risk on many levels (e.g., international, national, regional, and local), and is the result of the interaction of many different elements. In this course, we start by examining some basic issues with regard to risk analysis as well as why forecasts often fall short before examining three broad issues: country structural fragility; problems with collective action policymaking; and operational breakdowns. The first looks at how the sociopolitical and institutional dynamics of a country affects its evolution. The second looks at how the policy formulation process works and why it often yields a less than ideal result. The third looks at the challenges of implementation. As such, the class focuses more on the risks that face countries than on how particular risks might impact corporations or NGOs, though the latter is also examined. The two types of risks are related but are not identical (e.g., regulatory changes may be good for a country, but bad for a company or NGO). We conclude by examining how to prioritize and mitigate risk. Each class aims to provide students with a set of frameworks to think about and assess these issues. Students all get a chance to work on case studies to develop their skills.

The second section of the course focuses on developing countries’ embrace of economic globalization over the past thirty years.  We examine different political reasons for why emerging market and developing countries have liberalized foreign trade, removed barriers to foreign investment, and reduced the state’s role in the domestic economy since the 1980s.  The final section of the course of the course explores how globalization has impacted emerging market economies, and considers how governments in these countries have dealt with the new challenges that have emerged in this era of economic globalization.

The course will cover both the systemic/structural and targeted/tactical levels of the fight. At the systemic level, governments are working to lift the tide for all boats, and enhance global anti-money laundering and combating terrorist financing (AML/CFT) standards and implementation. In the targeted arena, law enforcement, intelligence, and private sector compliance officers are tracking and targeting financial flows as a means to unravel plots, uncover conspirators, and disrupt networks. At the same time, illicit actors have become more sophisticated and more resourceful in hiding and moving money. Students will learn not just what is being done but how to critically assess tools and policy efforts in the field.

In the first portion of the course students learn about the development of nuclear weapons programs during the Second World War and the Cold War and the differences in proliferation and non-proliferation strategies among early proliferators (e.g. the United States and the Soviet Union). During this portion of the course, students will examine important incidents and policy decisions that shaped nuclear proliferation in world politics. In the second portion of the course, students will learn broader theoretical concepts in International Relations scholarship such as brinkmanship diplomacy, deterrence theory, and alliance security dilemma, and apply them to the study of cases of proliferation, attempted proliferation, and nuclear latency in East Asian countries, including China, South Korea, North Korea, Taiwan, Japan and Australia in order to understand the variance in nuclear exploration, pursuit, and acquisition. The course draws upon canonical texts in the nuclear politics and history literature, and also incorporates recent policy analysis. This course relies on declassified archival documents to illustrate the history and theories addressed in the class, thus fostering a breadth of knowledge on different nuclear weapons cases. While we analyze these cases, I encourage students to engage with primary source documents as well as to think critically and evaluate the arguments put forward by historians and political scientists on nuclear proliferation and non-proliferation.

Specifically, they can read for key ideas and some supporting detail by answering questions on the content of assigned readings featuring description and narration and recapitulation of the reading material. They are also able to meet a number of practical writing needs. <a href=""http://www.sais-jhu.edu/content/summer-programs#overview"" target="" target=""_blank"">Click here to learn more about Summer Programs</a>","['SA Arabic', 'SB Language']",Nitze School of Advanced International Studies,0.00,

Summer 2019,,['SAIS Bologna '],20,"Italian, Intensive","Intensive Italian is a beginner’s course that aims at providing students with basic communication and cultural skills in Italian, enabling them to participate in different contexts in Italian society. Depending on individual motivation, commitment, experience and language background, the course should allow students to reach between the A1 (Breakthrough) A2 (Way stage) levels of the Common European Framework of Reference. The CEFR describes what a learner is supposed to be able to do in reading, listening, speaking and writing at each level, specifically:

A1. Can understand and use familiar everyday expressions and very basic phrases aimed at the satisfaction of needs of a concrete type. Can introduce him/herself and others and can ask and answer questions about personal details such as where he/she lives, people he/she knows and things he/she has. Can interact in a simple way provided the other person talks slowly and clearly and is prepared to help.

A2. Can understand sentences and frequently used expressions related to areas of most immediate relevance (e.g. very basic personal and family information, shopping, local geography, employment). Can communicate in simple and routine tasks requiring a simple and direct exchange of information on familiar and routine matters. Can describe in simple terms aspects of his/her background, immediate environment and matters in areas of immediate need.

The approach is communicative: priority will be given to the ability to express oneself meaningfully and to make oneself understood.

Language is always presented in context; grammar, phonology, lexis and all other features of actual language use in every-day situations are analyzed.

 The course intends to develop the four skills of listening, speaking, reading and writing, however the main focus will be on speaking and listening in order to give the students the opportunity to interact with native speakers as soon as possible and take advantage of living in Italy.","['SA Italian', 'SB Language']",Nitze School of Advanced International Studies,0.00,
Summer 2019,,['SAIS Bologna '],20,"Italian, Survival","The course will seek to provide elementary vocabulary, main structures and basic rules of grammar in a steady, progressive, direct and lively fashion. It is hoped to avoid as much as possible reference to and translation from English, as well as mechanical study of grammar during the lessons. The method aims to help students to think in Italian from the start, and to understand and deduce the rules rather than simply applying them.  A detailed course syllabus listing communicative functions, grammatical points and discourse markers, will be available at the beginning of each week. An instructor will be available for consultation with students 1 afternoon per week. This course is designed to be combined with preterm economics course. The course does not carry credit and will be dropped from the transcript once preterm is over.","['SA Italian', 'SB Language']",Nitze School of Advanced International Studies,0.00,
Summer 2019,,['SAIS Bologna '],20,Intensive English,"This course is designed to help students who are not native speakers of the English language achieve the academic level necessary to get the most out of a graduate-level SAIS education. The course seeks to facilitate sufficient fluency for students to follow lectures, participate in discussions and write papers in English. It includes: academic writing, vocabulary building, short lectures by faculty, oral presentations, a research paper and an introduction to the use of library resources. The course is oriented towards the subjects taught at the Bologna Center and aims to give the students the confidence necessary to participate actively in the Bologna Center program. Students with a TOEFL score between 100-105 or an IELTS score of 7.5 or below are STRONGLY ADVISED to participate in the Intensive English course. Classes meet four hours a day and the course is considered to be as much of a work commitment as “Intensive Italian’. Hence, while ‘Intensive English’ may be combined with attendance in a CORE or ECONOMICS course, the workload is likely to be so heavy that such a combined program of study is discouraged.",['SB Language'],Nitze School of Advanced International Studies,0.00,

It examines the effects of incentives on consumer and producer behavior and explores the conditions under which these incentives lead to efficient outcomes. The main goals of this course are to develop a detailed analysis of the market system, to provide an understanding of what justifies policy intervention in markets, and to assess the relative effectiveness of different policy tools in shaping market outcomes. 
The first part of the course lays the foundations of microeconomic analysis by modeling household and firm decisions in competitive markets. The second part of the course considers market failure due to imperfect competition, strategic behavior, asymmetric information, and externalities. The theoretical concepts in this course will be illustrated by applications to important social and policy problems: minimum wages, food stamps, labor supply, labor productivity, international trade, electoral competition, etc.",['SA International Economics and Finance'],Nitze School of Advanced International Studies,0.00,
