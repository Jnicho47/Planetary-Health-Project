**User**

Hello cursor, i have a project with the following requirements: This project builds on a course landscape analysis I conducted using AI to assess the current baseline of Planetary Health content at JHU. We’re now hoping to recreate and refine the process, potentially using some of the methods you developed around the sustainability course. We’d like something non-coders could use as a repeatable model for future use. 

 

Key tasks will include (as time permits): 

Using Python or a recommended programming language to scrape and analyze course data across JHU schools, utilizing the entire JHU course catalog (we have a pdf version you can use) 
Identifying and categorizing relevant courses by focus area 
Helping develop a systematized framework for tracking Planetary Health education each year 
Measuring key metrics such as course enrollment, department trends, and topical gaps 
 

This work will play a key role in shaping how we expand and strengthen our education program, helping us embed Planetary Health more effectively across JHU divisions. 

I have code for parts of the process, including a script to extracting the semesterly data from the online course catalog (so ignore the pdf part), analysis using basic rule based classification and currently developing a semantics based classification. Given the information and code that I can provide, how would you move forward?

---

**Cursor**

Thank you for the detailed background! Here’s a step-by-step plan for how I would move forward, given your goals and the context you provided:

---

## 1. **Clarify the End-User Experience**
- **Goal:** Make the process repeatable and usable by non-coders.
- **Action:** Decide on the final interface:  
  - A simple web app (e.g., Streamlit, Gradio, or Flask)  
  - A desktop GUI (e.g., Tkinter, PyQt)  
  - Or a command-line tool with clear instructions

---

## 2. **Review and Modularize Existing Code**
- **Goal:** Ensure your scripts for scraping, rule-based, and semantic classification are modular and reusable.
- **Action:**  
  - Organize code into functions or classes (e.g., `scrape_courses()`, `classify_courses()`, `analyze_metrics()`)
  - Separate data extraction, classification, and analysis logic

---

## 3. **Design a Systematic Framework**
- **Goal:** Enable annual tracking and easy updates.
- **Action:**  
  - Define a data schema (e.g., CSV, SQLite, or simple JSON) for storing course data and results
  - Include fields for year, department, course ID, focus area, enrollment, etc.
  - Document the process so others can follow it

---

## 4. **Enhance and Integrate Classification Methods**
- **Goal:** Improve accuracy and flexibility of course categorization.
- **Action:**  
  - Combine rule-based and semantic (AI/ML) classification
  - Allow for easy updating of rules/keywords and retraining of models
  - Provide a way for users to review and correct classifications

---

## 5. **Develop Metrics and Reporting**
- **Goal:** Track enrollment, trends, and gaps.
- **Action:**  
  - Implement functions to calculate and visualize metrics (e.g., using pandas, matplotlib, or seaborn)
  - Output results as tables, charts, and downloadable files

---

## 6. **Build the User Interface**
- **Goal:** Make it accessible to non-coders.
- **Action:**  
  - If web-based: Use Streamlit or Gradio for rapid prototyping
  - If desktop: Use Tkinter or PyQt for a simple GUI
  - Include clear instructions, tooltips, and error handling

---

## 7. **Documentation and Repeatability**
- **Goal:** Ensure others can use and adapt the tool.
- **Action:**  
  - Write a step-by-step README
  - Include sample data and example outputs
  - Provide instructions for updating course data each year

---

## 8. **Testing and Feedback**
- **Goal:** Validate usability and accuracy.
- **Action:**  
  - Test with real users (ideally non-coders)
  - Gather feedback and iterate

---

### **Next Steps for You**
1. **Share your existing code** (especially the scraping and classification parts).
2. **Clarify your preferred interface** (web, desktop, or command-line).
3. **List any specific requirements** (e.g., must run offline, must export to Excel, etc.).

Once you provide your code and preferences, I can help you:
- Refactor and modularize your scripts
- Design the user interface
- Integrate everything into a repeatable, user-friendly tool

Would you like to start by sharing your code, or do you want to discuss the interface and framework design first?

Here is my existing code along with a screenshot of taxonomy for planetary health courses. For a little more clarification, the idea is to classify the classes into four groups: not related to planetary health, about planetary health, talking about a planetary health core concept (see tier 2 in the keyword classification), and planetary health adjacent. I think the best interface would be a website whose results can be exported to a csv but Im open to suggestions. Before you do that, however, I want you to write all the necessary code to meet the requirements and do further code to explore more methods of analysis not only for the fall semester but for every academic year

---

**Cursor**

Thank you for sharing your code and clarifying your goals! Here’s a plan and the next steps to meet your requirements, including code improvements, new features, and additional analyses. I’ll break this into clear, actionable modules, and then provide the code for each.

---

## **Plan & Modules**

### **1. Data Extraction**
- **Goal:** Scrape all courses for all available semesters/years, not just Fall 2025.
- **Action:** Generalize your scraping code to loop through all terms/semesters.

### **2. Data Storage & Structure**
- **Goal:** Store all course data in a structured, repeatable format (CSV/JSON).
- **Action:** Save each year/semester’s data with a timestamp or term label.

### **3. Classification (Rule-based & Semantic)**
- **Goal:** Classify courses into four groups using both keyword and semantic methods.
- **Action:** Modularize and combine your rule-based and semantic classification.

### **4. Metrics & Analysis**
- **Goal:** Analyze trends, enrollment, department distribution, and topical gaps over time.
- **Action:** Implement functions for:
  - Yearly/semesterly trends
  - Departmental breakdowns
  - Gaps in coverage (taxonomy vs. course content)
  - Enrollment analysis (if data available)

### **5. Web Interface**
- **Goal:** Build a user-friendly web app (Streamlit recommended for speed and CSV export).
- **Action:** Allow users to:
  - Select year/semester
  - View and filter classified courses
  - Download results as CSV
  - Visualize trends and gaps

### **6. Documentation & Repeatability**
- **Goal:** Make it easy for non-coders to use and update.
- **Action:** Write clear instructions and modularize code for easy updates.

---

## **Step-by-Step Code Implementation**

### **1. Generalize Data Extraction for All Years/Semesters**

First, let’s get all available terms (years/semesters) and scrape all data:

```python
# 1. Get all available terms (example: ["Fall 2025", "Spring 2025", ...])
def get_all_terms():
    # This endpoint or method may need to be adapted based on the API
    # For now, let's assume you have a list or can scrape it from the catalog
    return ["Fall 2025", "Spring 2025", "Fall 2024", "Spring 2024"]  # etc.

# 2. Scrape all courses for all terms
def scrape_all_years(max_pages=1000):
    all_data = []
    for term in get_all_terms():
        print(f"Scraping {term}...")
        df = scrape_all_pages(term=term, max_pages=max_pages)
        df["Term"] = term
        all_data.append(df)
    return pd.concat(all_data, ignore_index=True)

# Usage:
df_all = scrape_all_years()
df_all.to_csv("all_courses.csv", index=False)
```

---

### **2. Modularize and Combine Classification Methods**

#### **Rule-based Classification (with 4 groups)**

```python
def label_course(text):
    text = text.lower()
    if any(kw in text for kw in tier1):
        return "About Planetary Health"
    elif any(kw in text for kw in tier2):
        return "Planetary Health Core Concept"
    elif any(kw in text for kw in tier3):
        return "Planetary Health Adjacent"
    else:
        return "Not Related"
```

#### **Semantic Classification (with 4 groups, using thresholds)**

```python
def semantic_label(score, thresholds=(0.7, 0.5, 0.3)):
    if score >= thresholds[0]:
        return "About Planetary Health"
    elif score >= thresholds[1]:
        return "Planetary Health Core Concept"
    elif score >= thresholds[2]:
        return "Planetary Health Adjacent"
    else:
        return "Not Related"
```

---

### **3. Metrics & Analysis Functions**

#### **Yearly Trends**

```python
def plot_yearly_trends(df, label_col="PH_Label"):
    df["Year"] = df["Term"].str.extract(r'(\d{4})')
    yearly = df.groupby(["Year", label_col]).size().unstack(fill_value=0)
    yearly.plot(kind="bar", stacked=True, figsize=(12,6), title="Planetary Health Course Trends by Year")
```

#### **Departmental Breakdown**

```python
def plot_departmental_breakdown(df, label_col="PH_Label"):
    dept = df.groupby(["Department", label_col]).size().unstack(fill_value=0)
    dept = dept[dept.sum(axis=1) > 0]  # filter depts with at least one match
    dept.plot(kind="barh", stacked=True, figsize=(10,20), title="Departmental Distribution")
```

#### **Taxonomy Coverage (Gaps)**

```python
def taxonomy_coverage(df, taxonomy_keywords):
    # taxonomy_keywords: dict of {category: [keywords]}
    coverage = {}
    for cat, kws in taxonomy_keywords.items():
        coverage[cat] = df["full_text"].apply(lambda x: any(kw in x for kw in kws)).sum()
    return pd.Series(coverage)
```

---

### **4. Streamlit Web App Skeleton**

```python
# streamlit_app.py
import streamlit as st
import pandas as pd

st.title("JHU Planetary Health Course Analysis")

uploaded = st.file_uploader("Upload course data CSV", type="csv")
if uploaded:
    df = pd.read_csv(uploaded)
    st.write("Data Preview:", df.head())

    # Classification
    df["PH_Label"] = df["full_text"].apply(label_course)
    st.write("Classification Counts:", df["PH_Label"].value_counts())

    # Download
    st.download_button("Download Results as CSV", df.to_csv(index=False), "classified_courses.csv")

    # Visualizations
    plot_yearly_trends(df)
    plot_departmental_breakdown(df)
```

---

### **5. Documentation**

- Add a `README.md` with:
  - How to run the scraper
  - How to update terms/years
  - How to run the Streamlit app
  - How to interpret results

---

## **6. Additional Analyses to Explore**

- **Topic Modeling:** Use LDA or BERTopic to find hidden themes in course descriptions.
- **Network Analysis:** Map connections between departments and topics.
- **Enrollment Trends:** If enrollment data is available, analyze by year/department/topic.
- **Gap Analysis:** Compare taxonomy coverage year-over-year.

---

## **Next Steps**

1. I will write the code for each of these modules in your workspace.
2. I’ll ensure the code is modular, documented, and ready for integration into a Streamlit app.
3. I’ll provide a sample `README.md` and instructions for use.

**Would you like me to start with the data extraction/generalization, or do you want to prioritize the web interface and classification logic first?**  
Let me know if you have a preferred order or any additional requirements!

```python
# 1. Get all available terms (example: ["Fall 2025", "Spring 2025", ...])

    return ["Fall 2025", "Spring 2025", "Fall 2024", "Spring 2024"]  # etc.

# 2. Scrape all courses for all terms
def scrape_all_years(max_pages=1000):
    all_data = []
    for term in get_all_terms():
        print(f"Scraping {term}...")
        df = scrape_all_pages(term=term, max_pages=max_pages)
        df["Term"] = term
        all_data.append(df)

**User**

Follow the outline you just provided

---

**Cursor**

It looks like you are currently at the system root directory, not inside your project folder. To proceed with the outlined plan, I need to be in your project directory where your code and data are located.

**Please navigate to your project directory** (where your scripts and data files are stored), or let me know the path so I can continue with the following steps:

1. Generalize and modularize the data extraction for all years/semesters.
2. Organize and structure the data storage.
3. Refactor and combine the classification logic.
4. Implement metrics and analysis functions.
5. Set up the Streamlit web app skeleton.
6. Add documentation and instructions.

Once you’re in the correct directory, I’ll begin implementing the modules as outlined!

---

**User**

how do i do that

---

**Cursor**

To navigate to your project directory, you need to use the `cd` (change directory) command in your terminal. Here’s how you can do it:

---

### **Step-by-Step Instructions**

1. **Open your terminal** (if it’s not already open).

2. **Find your project folder’s path.**
   - If you know the folder name and it’s in your home directory, you can use:  
     ```bash
     cd ~/your_project_folder_name
     ```
   - If you’re not sure where it is, you can list folders in your home directory with:  
     ```bash
     ls ~
     ```
     Then look for your project folder’s name.

3. **Navigate to the folder.**
   - For example, if your project is called `planetary_health`, you would type:  
     ```bash
     cd ~/planetary_health
     ```
   - If it’s on your Desktop:  
     ```bash
     cd ~/Desktop/planetary_health
     ```

4. **Confirm you’re in the right place.**
   - List the files in the directory:  
     ```bash
     ls
     ```
   - You should see your scripts and data files (e.g., `.py`, `.csv`, `.json` files).

---

### **If You’re Using Cursor or a Code Editor**

- You can usually right-click the project folder and select “Open in Terminal” or “Open in Integrated Terminal.”
- Or, use the built-in terminal in your editor and `cd` as above.

---

**Once you’re in your project directory, let me know (or just say “I’m here”), and I’ll continue with the code implementation!**  
If you’re unsure of your project’s location, let me know what files you see after running `ls` and I can help you further.

```shellscript
     cd ~/your_project_folder_name
```

```shellscript
     ls ~
```

```shellscript
     cd ~/planetary_health
```

```shellscript
     cd ~/Desktop/planetary_health
```

```shellscript
     ls
```

**Cursor**

Great! You are now in your project directory. Here’s how I’ll proceed, following the outline:

1. **Generalize Data Extraction**: Create a script to extract courses for all available terms/years, not just Fall 2025.
2. **Organize Data Storage**: Save all course data in a structured format (CSV/JSON) with term/year labels.
3. **Refactor Classification**: Modularize and combine rule-based and semantic classification for four groups.
4. **Metrics & Analysis**: Implement functions for trends, department breakdowns, taxonomy coverage, and more.
5. **Streamlit Web App**: Set up a user-friendly web interface for non-coders, with CSV export and visualizations.
6. **Documentation**: Add a README and clear instructions.

I’ll start by creating a Python module for generalized data extraction and storage, then proceed step by step. Let’s begin!

```python
import requests
import json
import pandas as pd
import os

# === Constants for extraction ===
url = "https://tn8v7j8xyu3u3rpg.ai.typesense.net/multi_search"

}

# === List of terms to extract ===
TERMS = [
    "Fall 2025", "Spring 2025", "Fall 2024", "Spring 2024", "Fall 2023", "Spring 2023"
    # Add more as needed or automate discovery if possible

    })
    response = requests.post(url, params=params, headers=headers, data=data)
    return response.json()

def scrape_all_pages(term, max_pages=1000):
    all_courses = []
    for page in range(1, max_pages + 1):
        res = get_all_courses(page=page, term=term)
        sections = res.get("results", [{}])[0].get("hits", [])
        if not sections:
            break
        for s in sections:
            doc = s.get("document", {})
            all_courses.append({
                "Semester": term,
                "Location": doc.get("LocationDelimited"),

                "Credits": doc.get("Credits"),
                "Status": doc.get("Status"),
            })
    return pd.DataFrame(all_courses)

def scrape_all_years(terms=TERMS, max_pages=1000, outdir="all_terms_data"):
    os.makedirs(outdir, exist_ok=True)
    all_data = []
    for term in terms:
        print(f"Scraping {term}...")
        df = scrape_all_pages(term=term, max_pages=max_pages)
        if not df.empty:
            df.to_csv(os.path.join(outdir, f"{term.replace(' ', '_')}.csv"), index=False)
            all_data.append(df)
    if all_data:
        df_all = pd.concat(all_data, ignore_index=True)
        df_all.to_csv(os.path.join(outdir, "all_courses.csv"), index=False)
        print(f"Saved all courses to {os.path.join(outdir, 'all_courses.csv')}")
    else:
        print("No data scraped.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    scrape_all_years()

```

It looks like I don't have permission to create new files in your current environment. However, you can easily copy and paste the following script into a new file in your project directory (e.g., name it `extract_all_terms.py`).

**Next Steps:**
1. Copy the above code into a new file named `extract_all_terms.py` in your project directory.
2. Run it with:
   ```bash
   python extract_all_terms.py
   ```
3. This will create a folder `all_terms_data` with CSVs for each term and a combined `all_courses.csv`.

Let me know when you’ve done this, and I’ll proceed to the next step: modularizing and combining the classification logic!

how can i allow you to create new files

---

**Cursor**

Currently, you are running Cursor in a restricted environment where the file system is read-only for the AI agent. This is a security feature in some setups (such as remote, cloud, or certain local environments) to prevent unauthorized file creation or modification.

### **How to Enable File Creation for the AI Agent**

#### **1. Local Environment (Recommended)**
If you run Cursor (or VS Code, or your Jupyter environment) locally on your own computer, and you open your project folder directly, the AI agent should have permission to create and edit files in that folder.

**Steps:**
- Open Cursor (or your code editor) on your local machine.
- Use “Open Folder” and select your project directory (`/Users/JonathanNichols/Planetary Health Project`).
- Make sure you are not in a “read-only” or “preview” mode.
- Try asking the AI to create a file again.

#### **2. Cloud/Remote Environments**
If you are using a cloud-based or remote environment (e.g., GitHub Codespaces, Google Colab, or a remote server), file creation may be restricted by the platform.

- **Check for a “read-only” warning** in your editor or terminal.
- **Look for a “Trust Workspace” or “Enable Write Access” button**—some platforms require you to explicitly allow file writes.
- **Contact your system administrator** if you are on a managed system.

#### **3. Permissions**
- Make sure your user account has write permissions to the project directory.
- In the terminal, you can check and set permissions with:
  ```bash
  ls -l /Users/JonathanNichols/Planetary\ Health\ Project
  chmod u+w /Users/JonathanNichols/Planetary\ Health\ Project
  ```

#### **4. Cursor Settings**
- If you are using Cursor, check the settings or documentation for any “sandbox” or “read-only” mode and disable it if possible.

---

### **Workaround**
If you cannot change the permissions, you can always copy-paste the code I provide into new files manually. This is a safe and effective workaround.

---

**Let me know if you need help with any of these steps, or tell me which environment you’re using (local, cloud, etc.) and I can give more specific instructions!**

```shellscript
  ls -l /Users/JonathanNichols/Planetary\ Health\ Project
  chmod u+w /Users/JonathanNichols/Planetary\ Health\ Project
```

I'm still unable to create new files due to the read-only file system restriction in your environment.

**What you can do:**
1. Copy the code I provided above for `extract_all_terms.py`.
2. Open your code editor (Cursor, VS Code, etc.) in your project directory.
3. Create a new file named `extract_all_terms.py`.
4. Paste the code into that file and save it.

Once you’ve done this, let me know! I’ll then proceed to the next step: modularizing and combining the classification logic for your project.

If you encounter any issues or need the next module’s code, just let me know!
